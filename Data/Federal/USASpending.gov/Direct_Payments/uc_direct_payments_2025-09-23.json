    "Description": "THE PROJECT TEAM FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ (UCSC) AND OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY (OSU) WILL EVALUATE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCCESSFUL DRY-FARMED TOMATO PRODUCTION. DRY-FARMED TOMATOES ARE GROWN BY SMALL-SCALE ORGANIC FARMERS IN COASTAL CALIFORNIA AND THE WILLAMETTE VALLEY OF OREGON. HOWEVER, DROUGHT STRESS CAN EXACERBATE PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS LIKE BLOSSOM-END ROT (BER), WHICH CAN RESULT IN CROP FAILURE. UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS THAT UNDERPIN DRY-FARMED TOMATO SUCCESS WILL ALLOW BREEDERS AND FARMERS TO DEVELOP TOMATO VARIETIES THAT CAN TOLERATE DROUGHT AND PRODUCE HIGH-QUALITY FRUIT. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AS CLIMATE CHANGE WILL RESULT IN HOTTER AND DRIER SUMMERS IN THE WESTERN US. THE PROJECT TEAM WILL: (A) CONDUCT AND COMPARE PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS ALONG WITH YIELD AND FRUIT QUALITY MEASUREMENTS USING DRY-FARMED AND IRRIGATED TOMATOES TO DETERMINE HOW THEY DIFFER, (B) EVALUATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS AND YIELD AND BER FOR DRY-FARMED TOMATO GROWN UNDER DIFFERENT CONDITIONS, (C) CONDUCT ON-FARM TRIALS FOR HIGH-PERFORMING VARIETIES, ALLOWING FARMERS TO ASSESS THEIR QUALITY, AND (D) SHARE PROJECT FINDINGS WITH DRY-FARMED VEGETABLE GROWERS IN CALIFORNIA AND OREGON. THE TEAM EXPECTS THAT SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED MARKETABLE YIELDS AND REDUCED LOSSES TO PHYSIOLOGICAL DISORDERS, ALLOWING FARMERS AND BREEDERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHICH TRAITS TO TARGET WHEN BREEDING TOMATOES FOR DRY FARMING. THE TWO RESEARCH TEAMS HAVE A NETWORK OF COLLABORATING FARMERS, WHOLESALERS, AND AGRICULTURAL PROFESSIONALS WHO PRACTICE DRY FARMING IN OREGON AND CALIFORNIA. OREGON HAS A GOOD MODEL OF A LONG-STANDING DRY FARM COLLABORATIVE THAT MEETS ANNUALLY, AND WITHIN CALIFORNIAS CENTRAL COAST NETWORK OF GROWERS THE PROJECT TEAM IS WORKING TO ESTABLISH A GROUP FOCUSED ON DRY FARM TOMATOES. THESE DRY FARM COLLABORATIVE GROUPS WILL FORM A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE OF APPROXIMATELY 40 GROWERS AND WILL BE ENGAGED WITH PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, WITH A COHORT OF 5-7 -MORE INVOLVED AS ON-FARM TOMATO TRIAL SITES IN EACH STATE. IN ADDITION TO THESE COHORTS, THE FOUR FIELD DAYS OFFERED WILL BRING AN ESTIMATED 200 GROWERS COMBINED TO THE OSU AND UCSC FARM SITES OVER TWO SUMMERS. FURTHER BENEFICIARIES WILL BE THOSE REACHED WITH THE PUBLICATIONS, VIDEO, AND WEB INFORMATION ABOUT DRY-FARMING, AN ESTIMATED 1,000 GROWERS VIEWING DIGITAL INFORMATION AND 3,500 VIEWING DRY FARM TOMATO VIDEOS NATIONWIDE IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS. ACCESS TO IRRIGATION REMAINS A MAJOR CONCERN FOR AGRICULTURE IN THE WESTERN U.S. BY BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSIOLOGY OF DRY-FARMED CROPS, BOTH DRY-FARMED TOMATO GROWERS AND THE CALIFORNIA PROCESSED TOMATO INDUSTRY WILL BE BETTER EQUIPPED TO BREED VARIETIES THAT RESIST DROUGHT STRESS.",

    "Description": "IDENTIFYING THE ROLE OF PULSES IN A HEALTHFUL DIET: METABOLOMIC SIGNATURES OF DIETARY PULSES AND THEIR BENEFITS ON CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTORS - PULSES ARE MODERATE ENERGY DENSITY FOODS THAT ARE HIGH IN MULTIPLE NUTRITIVE FACTORS INCLUDING SOLUBLE AND INSOLUBLE FIBERS. MODEST PULSE CONSUMPTION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTH BENEFITS INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS IN GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND REDUCTIONS IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, SUGGESTING THAT INCREASING CONSUMPTION OF PULSES COULD HAVE POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THESE EFFECTS MAY EITHER BE ASSOCIATED WITH DIRECT PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPACTS, OR THROUGH SECONDARY EFFECTS MEDIATED BY THE MICROBIOME. DIETARY FIBER IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF THE GUT MICROBIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION. CURRENTLY, PULSE INTAKE ASSESSMENTS ARE BASED LARGELY ON DIETARY RECALLS, AND THUS DO NOT REFLECT INTERINDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY IN DIGESTIVE AND MICROBIAL ACTIONS THAT MAY MODULATE THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE. SINCE THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES TO PULSE CONSUMPTION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF NOVEL TOOLS FOR THE EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT OF POSTPRANDIAL RESPONSES TO PULSE INTAKE HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO POWER INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF PULSE CONSUMPTION. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS RESEARCH PROPOSAL IS TO EVALUATE HOW PULSE DIGESTION/MICROBIAL FERMENTATION INFLUENCE THE CIRCULATING AND EXCRETED METABOLOME AND HOW THESE CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE GUT MICROBIAL COMMUNITY AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN OVERWEIGHT-OBESE INDIVIDUALS FED A PULSE RICH DIET. TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: OBJECTIVE 1: USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED FEEDING STUDY, DEVELOP FOOD EXPOSURE SIGNATURES FOR PULSE ENRICHED DIETS. OBJECTIVE 2: DETERMINE IF A PULSE ENRICHED DIET MEETING THE USDA'S DIETARY GUIDELINES IMPROVES GLUCOSE REGULATION IN PERSONS AT-RISK FOR METABOLIC DISEASE.",

FURTHERMORE, 4 TO 10% INCREASE IS EXPECTED ANNUALLY IN DIABETES AND CVD IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE. MODERN SEDENTARY LIFE STYLES, LACK OF EXERCISE, AND/OR UNHEALTHY DIETS OFTEN WITH HIGH CALORIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASING OBESITY-INDUCED DIABETES AND CVD. ALTHOUGH THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR EVENTS RELATED TO OBESITY-INDUCED DIABETES AND CVD ARE STILL BEING ELUCIDATED, SUBCLINICAL INFLAMMATION HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE PROGRESSION OF DIABETES AND CVD. INTERESTINGLY, SOME FOOD COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN BELIEVED TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON SUBCLINICAL INFLAMMATION, DIABETES, CVD AND OTHER DISEASES, BUT THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THESE FOODS AND THEIR COMPONENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONSREMAIN TO BE ELUCIDATED.

EACH OF THESE WEB-BASED PLATFORMS IS AN INNOVATIVE WEB-RESOURCE COMPENDIUM FOR DECISION-SUPPORT AND LEARNING. THE PROPOSED PLATFORM FOR CALIFORNIA SPECIALTY CROPS WILL PROVIDE INTERACTIVE TOOLS AND CLIMATE INFORMATION TO IMPROVE CROP MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND REDUCE PRODUCTION RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CLIMATE VARIABILITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS EFFORT HAS BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN BOTH THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AS WELL AS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AND TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE NOTHING SIMILAR TO THIS EXISTS IN CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PROPOSING TO INITIATE THIS EFFORT WITH FEW SPECIALTY CROPS, TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING, ON-GOING AND PLANNED EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH, THIS APPROACH WOULD BE FOCUSED ON SELECTED SPECIALTY CROPS, OVERALL PROPOSED APPROACH COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ANNUAL CROPPING SYSTEMS, SHOULD THAT BE IDENTIFIED AS A CRITICAL NEED IN FUTURE YEARS.",

THE RESULTING F1 SEEDLINGS ARE GENETICALLY VARIABLE BECAUSE OF SEGREGATION IN THE GAMETES OF EACH PARENT. THIS RESULTS IN DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOLOGY AMONG INDIVIDUAL ROOTSTOCKS AND IN PERFORMANCE IN THE FIELD. THE UCB-1 HYBRID IS ONE OF THE MAIN PISTACHIO ROOTSTOCKS USED IN THE USA. IT IS PRODUCED FROM A CONTROLLED CROSS BETWEEN SPECIFIC CLONAL TREES OF PISTACIA ATLANTICA (FEMALE) X P. INTEGERRIMA (MALE), AND WAS SELECTED FOR ITS RESISTANCE TO VERTICILLIUM WILT, A SERIOUS SOIL PATHOGEN OF PISTACHIO. PISTACIA VERA CULTIVARS ARE GRAFTED ONTO UCB-1 OR OTHER ROOTSTOCK. MOST PISTACHIO PRODUCTION IN THE USA IS IN CALIFORNIA AND ITS FARM GATE VALUE IS ABOUT $2 BILLION DURING THE ON\" YEARS (IT IS ALTERNATE BEARING). PISTACHIO IS VERY DROUGHT TOLERANT AND GROWS NATURALLY IN DRY CLIMATES. IT HAS THE MOST SALT TOLERANCE OF ANY NUT TREE GROWN IN THE USA; THEREFORE GROWERS PLANT PISTACHIO ON MARGINAL LANDS OR USE WATERS OF POOR QUALITY IF SOIL OR WATER SALINITY LEVELS ARE TOO HIGH FOR ALMONDS OR GRAPES. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT IF THE MAXIMUM ROOT ZONE SOIL SALINITY IS LESS THAN 10 DS/M PISTACHIO GENOTYPES IN IRAN COULD BE IRRIGATED WITH SALINE WATER UP TO 8 DS/M. OTHERS REPORT THAT SOME PISTACHIO ORCHARDS CAN GROW WELL WHEN IRRIGATED WITH 3000 - 4000 PPM (4.7-6.3 DS/M) SOLUBLE SALTS. DIFFERENCES IN SALT TOLERANCE AMONG UCB-1 SEEDLINGS IS HOWEVER UNKNOWN.\"",

FUNGAL AND DOWNY MILDEW PLANT PATHOGENS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A WIDE RANGE OF CROPS, EITHER BY THEIR DIRECT EFFECT ON PLANT HEALTH AND YIELD REDUCTIONS, OR INDIRECTLY WITH REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON THE MOVEMENT/SHIPMENT OF PLANT MATERIAL INTENDED TO PREVENT PATHOGEN INTRODUCTION OR SPREAD. HOWEVER, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY AND SYSTEMATICALLY CHARACTERIZE MANY OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE PLANT PATHOGENS, ESPECIALLY FOR NEWLY EMERGENT PLANT PATHOGENS OR THOSE FOREIGN TO THE U.S. FOR MANY PLANT PATHOGENS THERE IS LIMITED SEQUENCE DATA TO SUPPORT ACCURATE IDENTIFICATIONS, DIAGNOSTIC TOOL DEVELOPMENT, OR TAXONOMIC ASSESSMENTS. THEREFORE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO ESTABLISH A ROBUST DATABASE OF GENOME RESOURCES FOR KEY PLANT PATHOGENS THREATENING U.S. CROPS. THE COLLABORATION ESTABLISHED IN THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THIS OBJECTIVE BY SHARING EXPERTISE WITH THE PLANT PATHOGENS AND GENERATING DNA AND RNA SEQUENCE DATA THAT WILL BE USED FOR GENETIC DIVERSITY STUDIES, DEVELOPMENT OF DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS, AND THE CHARACTERIZATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF NEWLY EMERGING PATHOGENS THREATENING HEALTHY PLANT PRODUCTION.",

    "Description": "ADAPTATION RESOURCES WORKBOOK/CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURE GUIDEBOOKS FOR CALIFORNIA SPECIALITY CROPS - CLIMATE CHANGE AND PRODUCTIVITY ARE VERY TIGHTLY LINKED IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR AND INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA. CLIMATE CHANGE AND VARIABILITY ARE HAVING AN ACUTE EFFECT ON AGRICULTURE IN CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INTENSIFY IN THE YEARS AND DECADES TO COME. AGRICULTURE'S FOOTPRINT IS ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S AREA, SO THE NEXUS AMONG CLIMATE, RESOURCE AVAILABILITY, AND ECONOMIC STABILITY IS CRITICAL. SPECIALTY CROP PRODUCERS CAN BENEFIT FROM ACTIONABLE, USER-DRIVEN RESOURCES TO ENABLE NIMBLE DECISION-MAKING IN THE FACE OF NEW CHALLENGES, AND TO BUILD LONG-TERM CAPACITY FOR ADAPTATION TO FUTURE CLIMATE STRESSORS. THE USDA CALIFORNIA CLIMATE HUB IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE JOHN MUIR INSTITUTE OF THE ENVIRONMENT PROPOSES TO CREATE AN ADAPTATION RESOURCES WORKBOOK FOR CALIFORNIA SPECIALTY CROP GROWERS TO RESPOND TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND VARIABILITY AS PART OF ITS MISSION TO DEVELOP,EDUCATE, AND DELIVER SCIENCE-BASED, REGION-SPECIFIC TOOLS FOR GROWERS. THE PROPOSED PRODUCT IS AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH BASED ON SUCCESSFUL ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES THAT WORKS AT THE SCALE OF FARMS AND FIELDS: THE SCALE AT WHICH GROWER DECISION-MAKING AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION OCCUR. THE SCOPE OF THIS WORKBOOK WILL BE GENERALLY APPLICABLE TO SPECIALTY CROP GROWERS (VINEYARDS, ORCHARDS, AND OTHER TREE NUT AND FRUIT SPECIALTY CROPS), BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND ORGANIC IN CA AND PORTIONS OF AZ WITH SIMILAR CROP TYPES AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRESSORS.",

RECENTLY, CYSDV-RESISTANT MELON VARIETIES HAVE BECOME COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE, AND THERE ARE EFFORTS TO RETURN TO SUMMER AND FALL MELON PRODUCTION IN THE REGION WITH THESE VARIETIES. HOWEVER, IN 2014, SQUASH VEIN YELLOWING VIRUS (SQVYV) EMERGED, WHICH CAN CAUSE COLLAPSE OF WATERMELON VINES, AND IN 2018, CUCURBIT CHLOROTIC YELLOWS VIRUS (CCYV) WAS IDENTIFIED, WHICH LOOKS IDENTICAL TO CYSDV BUT IS NOT CONTROLLED BY CYSDV RESISTANCE. WE WILL ENHANCE MANAGEMENT AND BY DETERMINING RESERVOIR HOSTS OF CCYV AND SQVYV IN CALIFORNIA, DEVELOP A UNIVERSAL DETECTION SYSTEM TO RAPIDLY DIFFERENTIATE ALL THREE VIRUSES, WHICH WILL IMPROVE RESISTANCE BREEDING EFFICIENCY, AND DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE VIRUS TRANSMISSION TO CUCURBITS.",

WINE GRAPES ARE UNIQUE FROM OTHER ANNUAL CROPS, IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES ON SOIL HEALTH HAVE OCCURRED. TRADITIONALLY, WINE GRAPE VINEYARDS ARE LOW INPUT SYSTEMS THAT MUST BALANCE YIELD, FRUIT CHEMISTRY AND SOIL CONSERVATION NEEDS. MANY SOIL CONSERVATION PRACTICES LIKE COVER CROPPING AND COMPOST ADDITION LEAD TO INCREASES IN SOIL NUTRIENT AVAILABILITY, WHICH MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO WINE GRAPE PRODUCTION. THIS WORK WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ONGOING COLLABORATIVE WORK WITH THE COOPERATOR ADDRESSING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOIL CONSERVATION PRACTICES, SOIL HEALTH INDICATORS AND THE SOIL MICROBIAL COMMUNITY IN WINE GRAPE VINEYARDS.",

CONDUCT A COORDINATED GERMPLASM EVALUATION EFFORT INVOLVING USDA-ARS (ABERDEEN AND PULLMAN); OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY, CORVALLIS; AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS. CLIMATE CHANGE, WITH INCREASINGLY VOLATILE SWINGS IN CLIMATE, CAN LEAD TO DISEASES APPEARING IN HERETOFORE SAFE HAVENS. THUS  WHILE STRIPE RUST OF BARLEY HAS BEEN MOST PREVALENT IN THE HIGH RAINFALL AREAS OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST  IT COULD EMERGE AS A THREAT ELSEWHERE IN THE US WITH A SIMPLE SHIFT IN WEATHER PATTERNS AND CROPPING SYSTEMS. THANKS TO SYSTEMATIC MAPPING AND INTROGRESSION EFFORTS  A CATALOG OF MAPPED RESISTANCE GENES AND QTLS IS AVAILABLE AS IS ELITE  ADAPTED GERMPLASM. THE PRICE OF HEALTHY CROPS  HOWEVER  IS ETERNAL EFFORT. IN THAT SPIRIT  THIS PROJECT HAS THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES. 1. DISCOVER NEW RESISTANCE GENES/QTLS. 2. CONFIRM THE RESISTANCE OF EXISTING  NEW  AND POTENTIAL VARIETIES. 3. MONITOR PATHOGEN VIRULENCE IN KEY PRODUCTION AREAS.",

CURRENT DETECTION TECHNIQUES DO NOT ADEQUATELY FULFILL THE NEED FOR SENSITIVE, ACCURATE, RAPID AND COST EFFECTIVE DETECTION OF THESE PATHOGENS, WHICH HINDERS EFFORTS AT DISEASE MANAGEMENT. THIS PROPOSAL WILL ADDRESS THIS BY EXPANDING A CURRENT RESEARCH PROJECT ON MOLECULAR DETECTION OF DOWNY MILDEW SPECIES TO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SPECIES. THE COLLABORATION ESTABLISHED IN THIS AGREEMENT WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THIS OBJECTIVE BY SHARING EXPERTISE WITH THE PATHOGENS AND GENERATING DNA SEQUENCE DATA THAT WILL BE USEFUL FOR DEVELOPING DIAGNOSTIC MARKERS.",

    "Description": "PROBIOTIC PROSPECTING FOR ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEES - ALTHOUGH CHALKBROOD CAN BE A MAJOR SOURCE OF MORTALITY FOR THE ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE, NO EFFECTIVE CONTROL STRATEGY CURRENTLY EXISTS. IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF A HEALTHY SOURCE OF POLLINATORS FOR ALFALFA SEED PRODUCTION, WE HAVE BEEN STUDYING INTERACTIONS BETWEEN BACTERIA AND FUNGI THAT RESIDE IN THE ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE LARVAL GUT. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO DISCOVER MICROBES THAT HINDER THE GROWTH OF ASCOSPHAERA AGGREGATA, THE FUNGUS THAT CAUSES CHALKBROOD. PREVIOUSLY, A. AGGREGATA WAS FOUND TO INHIBIT THE GROWTH OF OTHER FUNGI IN THE LARVAL GUT, BUT NO ANY SINGLE MICROBE WAS FOUND THAT INHIBITS THE GROWTH OF A. AGGREGATA. IN PREVIOUS WORK, ONE HINDRANCE TO TESTING THE EFFECT OF CERTAIN BACTERIA ON A. AGGREGATA WAS THAT THESE BACTERIA WERE RESISTANT TO THE ANTIBACTERIAL TREATMENTS WE USED TO REMOVE BACTERIA. ADDITIONALLY, IT MAY BE THAT COMBINATIONS OF BACTERIA WORK IN CONCERT TO INHIBIT A. AGGREGATA, WHICH WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TEASE OUT IN OUR PREVIOUS STUDY. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT IS TO STUDY HOW MANIPULATED BACTERIAL COMMUNITIES AFFECT THE GROWTH OF A. AGGREGATA IN THE LARVAL GUT AND SUBSEQUENTLY, THE INCIDENCE OF THE DISEASE CHALKBROOD. LACTOBACILLUS KUNKEEI, A BACTERIUM THAT WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE LARVAE, IS ONE OF A MIXTURE OF LACTIC ACID BACTERIA THAT PROTECTS HONEY BEE LARVAE FROM PATHOGENS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THESE BACTERIA MAY ACT AS PROBIOTICS (BACTERIA WHICH, WHEN INGESTED, INCREASE THE HEALTH OF AN ORGANISM), POSSIBLY BY INHIBITING A. AGGREGATA. THE FIRST STEP IN DETERMINING IF THESE BACTERIA CAN ACT AS PROBIOTICS FOR THE ALFALFA LEAFCUTTING BEE IS TO EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINE IF THESE BACTERIA AFFECT BEE HEALTH. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE 1) TO DETERMINE IF LACTOBACILLUS KUNKEEI CAN LOWER THE ABUNDANCE OF A. AGGREGATA IN THE LARVAL GUT AND THEREBY LOWER INCIDENCE OF CHALKBROOD AND 2) TO DETERMINE IF COMBINATIONS OF BACTERIA CAN LOW",

THE OBJECTIVE IS TO VALIDATE MOLECULAR QUANTIFICATION ASSAYS OF SOIL BY COMPARISON WITH SOIL PLATING ASSAYS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COLONY COUNTS AND RESULTS FROM REAL TIME POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (PCR) ASSAYS. WHEN APPROPRIATE GENOMIC SEQUENCING OF IMPORTANT ISOLATES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM RESULTS AND SUPPORT DIAGNOSTIC ASSAY VALIDATION. 2. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS WORK IS TO ANALYZE GENOMIC AND TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA FROM FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM F. SP. FRAGARIAE AND MACROPHOMINA PHASEOLINA INFECTING STRAWBERRY ROOTS. THIS WORK WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE SIGNALING AND METABOLIC PATHWAYS THAT ARE TRIGGED IN THE PLANT DURING INFECTION BY THESE PATHOGENS. RESULTS CAN BE USED TO INFORM METHODS THAT WILL BLOCK HOST COLONIZATION BY INTERFERING WITH THE DISRUPTED SIGNALING NETWORKS. IN ADDITION TO ANALYZING HOST RESPONSE, WE WILL IDENTIFY GENES THAT ARE UP-REGULATED DURING INFECTION BY THE FUNGUS. TRANSCRIPTOMIC DATA WAS COLLECTED FOR MULTIPLE ISOLATES OF FUSARIUM OXYSPORUM F. SP. FRAGARIAE AND IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY HOMOLOGS THAT ARE CONSISTENTLY UP-EXPRESSED BETWEEN ISOLATES. FURTHERMORE, GENES UNIQUE TO EACH GENOTYPE OF THIS PATHOGEN THAT ARE EXPRESSED DURING INFECTION WILL BE IDENTIFIED. GENOMIC COMPARISON WILL FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING EVOLUTIONARY MECHANISMS RESULTING IN HOST SPECIFICITY. THE OUTCOME OF THIS WORK WILL BE A FOUNDATIONAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN THIS HOST AND PATHOGEN AT THE TRANSCRIPTIONAL LEVEL.",

    "Description": "COMPARATIVE GENOMICS TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISM OF CURTOVIRUS TRANSMISSION BY THE BEET LEAFHOPPER, CIRCULIFER TENNELLUS - 1) COMPLETE INITIAL ANNOTATION OF THE GENOME OF THE BEET LEAFHOPPER (CIRCULIFER TENNELLUS). 2) COMPARE THE TRANSCRIPTOME AND C. TENNELLUS AFTER FEEDING ON HEALTHY SOURCE PLANTS, AND SOURCE PLANTS INFECTED WITH BEET CURLY TOP VIRUS TO ELUCIDATE GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES TRIGGERED BY FEEDING ON VIRUS-INFECTED PLANTS USING RNA-SEQ AND SMALL RNA ANALYSIS. 3) EXAMINE TISSUE-SPECIFIC GENE EXPRESSION DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEAFHOPPER GUT-WALL, WHICH VIRUS MUST PASS THROUGH TO BECOME TRANSMISSIBLE, AS WELL AS SALIVARY GLANDS, WHERE VIRUS ACCUMULATES PRIOR TO TRANSMISSION. RESULTS WILL IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING OF VIRUS-VECTOR INTERACTIONS, POSSIBLE IDENTIFICATION OF VIRUS RECEPTORS IN THE INSECT VECTOR, AND IDENTIFICATION OF NEW TARGETS FOR RNAI OR CRISPR/CAS9 BASED CONTROL OF LEAFHOPPER AND PREVENTION OF VIRUS INFECTION. THIS WILL PROVIDE NEW METHODS FOR CONTROL OF LEAFHOPPERS AND CURLY TOP IN AN ERA IN WHICH INSECTICIDE USE IS UNDER INCREASING SCRUTINY.",
