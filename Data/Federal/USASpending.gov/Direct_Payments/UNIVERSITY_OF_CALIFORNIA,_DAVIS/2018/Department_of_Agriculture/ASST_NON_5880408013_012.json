FURTHERMORE, 4 TO 10% INCREASE IS EXPECTED ANNUALLY IN DIABETES AND CVD IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE. MODERN SEDENTARY LIFE STYLES, LACK OF EXERCISE, AND/OR UNHEALTHY DIETS OFTEN WITH HIGH CALORIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR INCREASING OBESITY-INDUCED DIABETES AND CVD. ALTHOUGH THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR EVENTS RELATED TO OBESITY-INDUCED DIABETES AND CVD ARE STILL BEING ELUCIDATED, SUBCLINICAL INFLAMMATION HAS BEEN CONSIDERED A SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTOR FOR THE PROGRESSION OF DIABETES AND CVD. INTERESTINGLY, SOME FOOD COMPONENTS HAVE BEEN BELIEVED TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON SUBCLINICAL INFLAMMATION, DIABETES, CVD AND OTHER DISEASES, BUT THE MECHANISMS BEHIND THESE FOODS AND THEIR COMPONENTS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE ACTIONSREMAIN TO BE ELUCIDATED.
