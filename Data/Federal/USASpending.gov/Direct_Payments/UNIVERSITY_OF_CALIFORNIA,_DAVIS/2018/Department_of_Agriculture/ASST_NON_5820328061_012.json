THE RESULTING F1 SEEDLINGS ARE GENETICALLY VARIABLE BECAUSE OF SEGREGATION IN THE GAMETES OF EACH PARENT. THIS RESULTS IN DIFFERENCES IN MORPHOLOGY AMONG INDIVIDUAL ROOTSTOCKS AND IN PERFORMANCE IN THE FIELD. THE UCB-1 HYBRID IS ONE OF THE MAIN PISTACHIO ROOTSTOCKS USED IN THE USA. IT IS PRODUCED FROM A CONTROLLED CROSS BETWEEN SPECIFIC CLONAL TREES OF PISTACIA ATLANTICA (FEMALE) X P. INTEGERRIMA (MALE), AND WAS SELECTED FOR ITS RESISTANCE TO VERTICILLIUM WILT, A SERIOUS SOIL PATHOGEN OF PISTACHIO. PISTACIA VERA CULTIVARS ARE GRAFTED ONTO UCB-1 OR OTHER ROOTSTOCK. MOST PISTACHIO PRODUCTION IN THE USA IS IN CALIFORNIA AND ITS FARM GATE VALUE IS ABOUT $2 BILLION DURING THE ON\" YEARS (IT IS ALTERNATE BEARING). PISTACHIO IS VERY DROUGHT TOLERANT AND GROWS NATURALLY IN DRY CLIMATES. IT HAS THE MOST SALT TOLERANCE OF ANY NUT TREE GROWN IN THE USA; THEREFORE GROWERS PLANT PISTACHIO ON MARGINAL LANDS OR USE WATERS OF POOR QUALITY IF SOIL OR WATER SALINITY LEVELS ARE TOO HIGH FOR ALMONDS OR GRAPES. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT IF THE MAXIMUM ROOT ZONE SOIL SALINITY IS LESS THAN 10 DS/M PISTACHIO GENOTYPES IN IRAN COULD BE IRRIGATED WITH SALINE WATER UP TO 8 DS/M. OTHERS REPORT THAT SOME PISTACHIO ORCHARDS CAN GROW WELL WHEN IRRIGATED WITH 3000 - 4000 PPM (4.7-6.3 DS/M) SOLUBLE SALTS. DIFFERENCES IN SALT TOLERANCE AMONG UCB-1 SEEDLINGS IS HOWEVER UNKNOWN.\"",
