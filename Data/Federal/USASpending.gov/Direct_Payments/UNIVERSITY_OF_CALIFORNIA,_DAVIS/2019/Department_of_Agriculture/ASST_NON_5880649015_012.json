    "Description": "ECOLOGY OF CRIMEAN-CONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUS - CRIMEAN-CONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER (CCHF) IS CAUSED BY A TICK-BORNE VIRUS, IN THE FAMILY NAIROVIRIDAE. MAJOR GAPS REMAIN REGARDING DISEASE ECOLOGY AND LIFE CYCLE IN LIVESTOCK SPECIES AND TICKS. THIS PROJECT WILL SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS RESEARCH GAPS IN THE BSL4 RESEARCH PROGRAM AT THE NATIONAL AGRO AND BIO-DEFENSE FACILITY (NBAF), MANHATTAN, KS. ADDITIONAL BENEFITS INCLUDE ENHANCED KNOWLEDGE OF TICKS AND TICK-BORNE PATHOGENS. COLLECTED TICK SPECIMENS WILL BE SHARED AND SHIPPED TO OUR PARTNER LABORATORY AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION VIRAL SPECIAL PATHOGENS BRANCH, ATLANTA GEORGIA, FOR FURTHER VIRUS ISOLATION AND MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION. THESE SPECIMENS WILL FORM A KEY BIOLOGICAL RESOURCE OF RECENT FIELDSTRAINS AND INCREASE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE ECOLOGY OF CCHFV FROM REGIONS PREVIOUSLY UNDERREPRESENTED, INCREASE OUR CAPACITY TO CARRY OUT ECOLOGICAL STUDIES ON ZOONOTIC DISEASES IN ENDEMIC SETTINGS, AND ESTABLISH BIOSAFETY AND BIOSECURITY PROTOCOLS FOR SAMPLE COLLECTION, TRANSPORT AND LABORATORY ANALYSIS. FIELD-STRAIN COLLECTIONS WILL FORM THE BASIS OF A RELEVANT AND HIGHLY VALUABLE BIO-BANK FOR USDA NBAF ONCE OPERATIONAL. WHERE FEASIBLE, THE POST-DOCTORAL FELLOW WILL PARTICIPATE IN BSL-4 TRAINING AND LABORATORY ANALYSES TO ENSURE USDA NBAF HAS EXPERIENCED FIELD ECOLOGY PERSONNEL READY TO INVESTIGATE TICKBORNE ZOONOTIC VIRUSES UNDER FIELD AND MAXIMUM LABORATORY CONTAINMENT SETTINGS. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: 1- INITIATE FIELD STUDIES ON THE ECOLOGY OF CRIMEAN-CONGO HEMORRHAGIC FEVER VIRUS IN ENDEMIC SETTINGS, INCLUDING TICKS, DOMESTICATED LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE. 2- TRAIN FUTURE NBAF PERSONNEL ON FIELD STUDIES FOR BSL4 PROGRAM.",
