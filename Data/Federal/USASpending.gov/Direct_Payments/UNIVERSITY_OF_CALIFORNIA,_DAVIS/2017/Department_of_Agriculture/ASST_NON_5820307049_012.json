    "Description": "A GENOMICS-BASED APPROACH TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF AGRONOMICALLY IMPORTANT TRAITS IN WHEAT - THE IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVES OF THIS COOPERATIVE RESEARCH PROJECT ARE TO USE A GENOMICS-BASED APPROACH TO GENERATE WHEAT GENOMICS RESOURCES AND UTILIZE THEM TO UNDERSTAND GENETIC VARIATIONS IN CHROMOSOME REGIONS CONTROLLING END-USE QUALITY AND OTHER IMPORTANT TRAITS IN WHEAT. THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO UTILIZE THESE RESOURCES AND TOOLS FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF WHEAT THROUGH BREEDING AND BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPROACHES. THE FIRST PHASE OF THE RESEARCH WILL FOCUS ON DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE AND HIGH-THROUGHPUT TECHNOLOGY TO GENERATE TARGETED SEQUENCING DATA FOR GENOTYPING AND WHEAT DIVERSITY ASSAYS. THE SEQUENCE INFORMATION WILL BE USEFUL FOR DESIGNING MOLECULAR MARKERS TARGETED TO IMPORTANT TRAITS SUCH AS GRAIN QUALITY AND FLOUR ALLERGENICITY.",
