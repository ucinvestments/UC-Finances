    "Description": "EFFECTS OF EXTRACTION METHODS ON LENTIL AND DRY BEANS EXTRACT COMPOSITION AND STRUCTURAL MODIFICATION - OBJECTIVE 1: FRACTIONATE, QUANTIFY, AND CHARACTERIZE PROTEIN CLASSES FROM LENTILS AND DRY BEAN BASED ON THEIR SOLUBILITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF ULTRA-HIGH TEMPERATURE (UHT) TREATMENT ON DENATURATION OF EACH PROTEIN CLASS FOR SUBSEQUENT SELECTION OF PRE-HEATING TEMPERATURES. OBJECTIVE 2: PRODUCTION OF LENTIL AND DRY BEAN PROTEIN EXTRACTS WITH INCREASED PROTEIN CONTENT, FUNCTIONAL, AND BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES USING THE AQUEOUS EXTRACTION PROCESS (AEP) AND ENZYME-ASSISTED AQUEOUS EXTRACTION PROCESS (EAEP). OBJECTIVE 3: CONVERT THE FIBER-RICH FRACTION (BY-PRODUCT) GENERATED BY THE AEP/EAEP OF LENTIL AND DRY BEAN FLOUR INTO PREBIOTIC OLIGOSACCHARIDES USING AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY APPROACH. OBJECTIVE 4: EVALUATE ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE, ANTI-DIABETIC, PREBIOTIC, AND ANTI-INFECTIVE ACTIONS OF PROTEIN EXTRACTS PRODUCED BY THE AEP/EAEP METHOD (OBJ. 2), AND OF THE BIOACTIVE OLIGOSACCHARIDES PRODUCED FROM THE CONVERSION OF THE FIBER-RICH FRACTION (OBJ. 3). OBJECTIVE 5: EVALUATE THE THERMAL BEHAVIOR (DENATURATION TEMPERATURE) AND STRUCTURAL MODIFICATIONS (SURFACE HYDROPHOBICITY, ZETA-POTENTIAL, CIRCULAR DICHROISM) OF LENTIL AND DRY BEAN PROTEIN EXTRACTS PRODUCED IN OBJ. 2 AND IN ISOLATED PROTEIN FRACTIONS FROM OBJ. 1. OBJECTIVE 6: EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF PREHEATING TEMPERATURES AND HOLDING TIME PRIOR TO THE UHT TREATMENT ON PROTEIN DENATURATION AND FOULING FORMATION.",
