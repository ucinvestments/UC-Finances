    "Description": "UC AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES (UC ANR) IS THE LAND-GRANT ARM FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (AES) IS INTEGRATED WITH UC COOPERATIVE EXTENSION (UCCE) ACROSS THE STATE. UC ANR HAS PROGRAMS IN EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA, NINE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION CENTERS (RECS), TWO UC SYSTEMWIDE INSTITUTES, ELEVEN STATEWIDE PROGRAMS, AND A NEW UC ANR FIRE NETWORK. THE AES IS NOW ON FIVE UC CAMPUSES. IN NOVEMBER 2022, UC PRESIDENT MICHAEL DRAKE ANNOUNCED THE ADDITION OF TWO UC CAMPUSES TO FORMALLY JOIN THE UC AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION (AES), NAMELY UC SANTA CRUZ AND UC MERCED. WHILE UC ANR ALREADY HAD COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SPECIALISTS AT BOTH THOSE CAMPUSES CONDUCTING RESEARCH ON AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD-RELATED ISSUES, THE NEW AES DESIGNATION EXPANDS UC'S AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH PORTFOLIO. UC ANR CONTINUES TO PRIORITIZE GROWING THE UCCE PROGRAMMATIC FOOTPRINT ACROSS THE STATE. UC ANR HAS HIRED AROUND 100 NEW UCCE ACADEMICS GIVEN THE STATE BUDGET'S ADDITIONAL $32 MILLION IN ONGOING FUNDING, WHICH AIMS TO EXPAND UCCE'S ABILITY TO DEVELOP PRACTICAL, SCIENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S PRESSING CHALLENGES IN AGRICULTURE, NATURAL RE SOURCES, AND YOUTH AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH AND WELLNESS.

IN ADDITION, UC ANR IS EXPANDING THE PROGRAMMATIC FOOTPRINT BY HIRING MORE COMMUNITY EDUCATORS TO PROVIDE DIRECT EDUCATION, TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, AND EVALUATION SUPPORT FOR THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF UC ANR PROGRAMS. THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS TO HIGHLIGHT WHERE UC ANR IS SIGNIFICANTLY GROWING EXPERTISE FOR MORE IMPACT IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: COMMUNITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, A BROADER FOCUS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH, AND FIRE. THE UC ANR NETWORK ENGAGES ACADEMICS ACROSS THE ENTIRE UC SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE INTEGRATED TEAMS TO WORK ON COMPLEX ISSUES THAT REQUIRE MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO FIND SOLUTIONS. THE UC ANR CONNECTIONS ALSO INCLUDE FACULTY FROM THE STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM, PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES, ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING AGRICULTURAL AND NATURAL RESOURCE PRODUCTION, NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGO'S), AND OTHER INTEREST AREAS INCLUDING THE ENVIRONMENT, YOUTH, AND NUTRITION.

UC ANR HAS THE VISION OF MAKING A POSITIVE DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF EVERY CALIFORNIAN. UC ANR ENVISIONS A THRIVING CALIFORNIA WHERE HEALTHY PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES, HEALTHY FOOD SYSTEMS, AND HEALTHY ENVIRONMENTS ARE STRENGTHENED BY A CLOSE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND ITS RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAMS AND THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. UC ANR MEASURES ITS OUTCOMES IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS OF PUBLIC VALUE: ECONOMIC PROSPERITY, QUALIFIED WORKFORCE, ABUNDANT AND SAFE FOOD FOR ALL, PROTECTED NATURAL RESOURCES, CLIMATE RESILIENT COMMUNITIES AND ECOSYSTEMS, HEALTHY PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES, AND INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE SOCIETY.",
