UC ANR HAS A LONG TRADITION OF EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH, EXTENSION, AND TEACHING IN FORESTRY, CONDUCTING MCINTIRE-STENNIS FUNDED RESEARCH ON FOREST LANDS SINCE THE FUNDING OPPORTUNITY BEGAN. INTENDED BENEFICIARIES UC ANR RESEARCHERS ASSEMBLE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAMS TO CONDUCT FORESTRY RESEARCH, OUTREACH AND PUBLIC EDUCATION ACTIVITIES, AND POLICY ANALYSIS ON ISSUES AFFECTING FOREST LANDS ACROSS THE STATE, COUNTRY, AND WORLD. THESE PROJECTS TRAIN UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE AND POSTDOCTORAL SCIENTISTS, REACHING A TARGET AUDIENCE THAT INCLUDES FORESTRY SCIENTISTS, LAND MANAGERS AND OWNERS, STATE AND NATIONAL POLICYMAKERS, MANAGEMENT AGENCIES, ACADEMICS AND UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATORS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT PARTNERS, AMONG OTHERS.

ONE RESEARCH PROJECT WILL EMPLOY EMPIRICALLY BASED MODELS TO QUANTIFY THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC AND ECOSYSTEM SERVICE IMPACTS AND TRADEOFFS OF FOREST MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING FOREST AND HUMAN WELL-BEING. ANOTHER RESEARCH PROJECT AIMS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO RESTORE FIRE TO THE SIERRAN CONIFER FORESTS OF CALIFORNIA, FOR WHICH THERE IS LIMITED EMPIRICAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH A RESTORED FIRE REGIME. RETURNING AND MAINTAINING DISTURBANCE PROCESSES THAT MIMIC THE ROLE OF FIRE IN THE LANDSCAPE ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE WELFARE OF THE FORESTS AND THE COMMUNITIES THAT DEPEND ON THEM. THE SCIENTISTS ARE BUILDING ON LONG-TERM FIELD EXPERIMENTS TO QUANTIFY THE TRADE-OFFS ASSOCIATED WITH THREE RESTORATION APPROACHES: PRESCRIBED FIRE, MECHANICAL FUEL TREATMENTS, AND MANAGED FIRE. PRESCRIBED FIRES ARE BURNS CONDUCTED UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. MECHANICAL TREATMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE AVAILABILITY FUELS VIA HARVESTS AND REMOVAL OF DEBRIS. MANAGED WILDFIRE INVOLVES ALLOWING NATURALLY IGNITED WILDFIRES TO BURN UNDER LESS-THAN-EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS. ALL THREE STRATEGIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LIMIT FUTURE WILDFIRE HAZARD AND IMPROVE FOREST RESILIENCE. THE RESEARCH WILL BE CONDUCTED AT TWO FORESTS WITH DIVERGENT PRACTICAL AND LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON MANAGEMENT: A WORKING FOREST AND A NATIONAL PARK; THUS, THE RESULTS AND LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT IMPLEMENTATION ARE BROADLY RELEVANT TO THE PRACTICE OF FORESTRY.",
