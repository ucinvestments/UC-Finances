    "Description": "NOVEL SYSTEMIC DELIVERY OF PEPTIDE-MEDIATED ANTI-SENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDES FOR DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODIES - PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS OF THE AGING POPULATION ARE CHARACTERIZED BY THE PROGRESSIVE ACCUMULATION OF PROTEINS SUCH AS A-SYNUCLEIN (A-SYN), AMYLOID BETA (ASS) AND MICROTUBULE ASSOCIATE PROTEIN (TAU). MISFOLDED AND AGGREGATED A-SYN HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS WITH PARKINSONISM INCLUDING DEMENTIA WITH LEWY BODY, PARKINSON’S DISEASE (PD), AND MULTIPLE SYSTEMS ATROPHY. ACCUMULATION OF A-SYN HAS EVEN BEEN CONFIRMED IN OVER 50% OF ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE (AD). RECENT EVIDENCE POINTS TO A ROLE OF A-SYN ACCUMULATION IN THE AGGREGATION OF TAU AND ASS IN AD. THUS, REGULATION OF A-SYN EXPRESSION MAY BE CRUCIAL TO THE THERAPEUTIC CONTROL OF NUMEROUS NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. SHORT INTERFERING RNA MOLECULES (SIRNA) CAN BIND SPECIFICALLY TO TARGET RNAS AND DELIVER THEM FOR DEGRADATION; HOWEVER, RNA MOLECULES DO NOT CROSS THE BLOOD- BRAIN BARRIER SO THE ONLY METHOD FOR DELIVERY IS REPEAT INTRA-THECAL INJECTIONS. WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED A PEPTIDE (APOB11) THAT BINDS OLIGONUCLEOTIDES FOR TRANSPORT ACROSS THE BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER FOLLOWING SYSTEMIC ADMINISTRATION. USING THIS PEPTIDE, WE SHOWED THAT WE CAN DELIVER A SI A-SYN TO REDUCE EXPRESSION OF A- SYNUCLEIN IN A MOUSE. WE RECENTLY CONVERTED THE RIBONUCLEOTIDE BACKBONE OF THIS SIRNA TO A 2’-MOE ANTI-SENSE OLIGONUCLEOTIDE TO INCREASE HALF-LIFE AND AFFINITY TO THE MRNA TARGET. WE PLAN TO EXAMINE THE PHARMACOKINETICS AND TOXICOLOGY OF SYSTEMIC APOB11:2’-MOE SI A-SYN FOLLOWING INTRA-PERITONEAL DELIVERY IN AN A-SYN TG MOUSE MODEL OF DLB. THEN WE WILL EXAMINE THE ABILITY OF THE APOB11:2’-MOE SI A-SYN TO REDUCE A-SYN AND IMPROVE SURVIVAL OF NEURONS AND IMPROVE COGNITIVE ABILITY AND MOTOR COORDINATION IN AN A-SYN TG MOUSE MODEL OF DLB. FINALLY, WE WILL EXAMINE THE ABILITY OF THE APOB11:2’-MOE SI A-SYN TO REDUCE THE ACCUMULATION OF A-SYN IN AN IN VITRO MODEL OF HUMAN DLB NEURONS DERIVED FROM IPSC CELLS IN A BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER MODEL. WE BELIEVE THIS MAY REPRESENT A NEW METHOD OF THERAPEUTIC DELIVERY FOR DLB AND OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.",
