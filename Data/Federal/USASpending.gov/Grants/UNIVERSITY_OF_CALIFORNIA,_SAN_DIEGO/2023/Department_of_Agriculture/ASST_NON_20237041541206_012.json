    "Description": "FOOD INSECURITY IN CALIFORNIA AFFECTS 9.6% OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. HOWEVER, BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED WITH RATES RANGING FROM 14-20% COMPARED TO 4-7% AMONG WHITE RESIDENTS. THIS INEQUITY IS DRIVEN IN PART BY RECORD-SETTING FOOD PRICE INFLATION, PANDEMIC RELATED SUPPLY SHOCKS, AND OTHER MARKET DISRUPTIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS SITUATION, THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN DIEGO, WORKING WITH NORTHGATE GONZALEZ MARKETS AND OTHER COMMUNITY PARTNERS, DEVELOPED THE \u0026IEXCL;M\u0026AACUTE;S FRESCO! MORE FRESH NUTRITION INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE PURCHASE OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AND FOOD SECURITY LEVELS AMONG THOUSANDS OF PARTICIPATING HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS LOS ANGELES, ORANGE, SAN DIEGO, SAN BERNARDINO, AND RIVERSIDE COUNTIES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS NEW PROPOSAL IS TO OPTIMIZE AND FURTHER EXPAND THE IMPACT OF THIS ALREADY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM BY INCREASING ACCESS TO A BROADER ARRAY OF GUSNIP-QUALIFYING HEALTHY FOODS, NAMELY FRESH, FROZEN, DRIED, AND CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, WHILE USING DATA-DRIVEN DECISION MAKING TO OPTIMIZE OUR 4:1 EARN AND REDEEM INCENTIVE MODEL TO EXPAND AND SUSTAIN ITS SUPPORT FOR EXISTING AND NEW PARTICIPANTS OVER A LONGER TIMEFRAME. IN THIS WAY, THE PROGRAM WILL BE MORE SUCCESSFUL AT ADDRESSING FOOD SECURITY AND INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS, ESPECIALLY FOR THE LATINO COMMUNITY THAT NORTHGATE GONZALEZ MARKETS SERVES. STABLE AND CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES IN ITS MANY FORMS WILL BETTER ADDRESS THE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT SNAP RECIPIENTS EXPERIENCE, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ADVANCING EQUITY, INCLUSION, AND ACCESSIBILITY ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.",
