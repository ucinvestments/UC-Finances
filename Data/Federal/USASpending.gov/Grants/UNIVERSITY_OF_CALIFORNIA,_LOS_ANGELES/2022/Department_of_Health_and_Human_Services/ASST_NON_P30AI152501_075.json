    "Description": "UCLA-CDU CFAR - OVERALL: PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: THIS APPLICATION IS A RESUBMISSION FOR A NEW CFAR THAT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN UCLA AND CDU. OUR OVERARCHING GOAL IS TO CREATE A NIMBLE MULTI-INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROMOTES EQUITY AND WILL CONNECT AND SUPPORT INVESTIGATORS AFFILIATED WITH BOTH INSTITUTIONS TO ADVANCE CRITICAL HIV SCIENCE. THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL STRENGTHEN AND AMPLIFY THE IMPACT OF EXISTING RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND LAUNCH NEW PARTNERSHIPS ACROSS LOS ANGELES AND GLOBALLY THROUGH OUR FOCUS ON THREE THEMES: WE WILL STOP HIV BY PREVENTING NEW HIV INFECTIONS (PREVENTION), REDUCING MORBIDITY AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (TREATMENT) AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ERADICATION (ART-FREE REMISSION). THIS GRANT WILL FUND AIDS-RELATED ACTIVITIES AND PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY INVESTIGATORS AT UCLA, CDU AND OUR AFFILIATED INSTITUTIONS, WHICH INCLUDE HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER IN TORRANCE; THE UCLA CARE CLINIC AND THE VA GREATER LOS ANGELES HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN WESTWOOD; THE UCLA VINE STREET CLINIC IN WEST HOLLYWOOD; AND THE DREW CARES, THE CDU PUSH COALITION AND THE MLK OASIS CLINIC AT CDU. THESE FACILITIES ARE AT GROUND ZERO FOR THE AIDS EPIDEMIC IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY, WITH THE GREATEST NUMBER OF PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV RESIDING IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS DIRECTLY SERVED BY OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS. IN ADDITION TO THE FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS BASED IN LOS ANGELES, RESEARCHERS AT UCLA AND CDU HAVE EXTENSIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITH HIV PROGRAMS AROUND THE GLOBE THAT ARE AIMED AT BUILDING GLOBAL CAPACITY. THE CFAR WILL ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER RESEARCH AT THE INTERFACE OF COMMUNITY BY REACHING COMMUNITIES MOST IN NEED AND BY BRINGING TO BEAR THE TALENT OF CDU AND UCLA RESEARCHERS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS FROM A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVE WHILE MENTORING THE NEXT GENERATION WHO BETTER REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF COMMUNITIES BEING SERVED. THE OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF THE UCLA-CDU CFAR WILL ALLOW US TO EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AIDS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES BY HARNESSING THE DIVERSE EXPERTISE IN OUR CFAR, AND BY INCLUDING LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY- BASED CLINICIAN INVESTIGATORS AND COMMUNITIES. THE ACTION PLAN FOR THE FIRST YEAR OF REQUESTED SUPPORT INCLUDES 6 CORES AND 1 SCIENTIFIC WORKING GROUP (SWG): THE ADMINISTRATIVE CORE, DEVELOPMENTAL CORE, CENTRALIZED LABORATORY SUPPORT CORE, HUMANIZED MOUSE AND GENE THERAPY CORE, COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND CLINICAL INFORMATICS CORE, CLINICAL SCIENCE CORE, AND A TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH IN SUBSTANCE USE SWG. RELEVANCE: RESEARCH INTO THE PATHOGENESIS, TREATMENT AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF HIV DISEASE IS REQUIRED TO END THE EPIDEMIC. THE UCLA-CDU CFAR SEEKS TO CATALYZE AND EXPAND HIV RESEARCH BY PROVIDING THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO CONNECT, SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE CAPACITY OF INVESTIGATORS AFFILIATED WITH UCLA AND CDU. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED BY STIMULATING THE CONDUCT AND DISSEMINATION OF HIGH IMPACT MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH AIMED AT THE NIH PRIORITIES OF PREVENTING NEW HIV INFECTIONS (PREVENTION), REDUCING MORBIDITY AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (TREATMENT) AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES FOR ERADICATION (ART-FREE REMISSION).",
