IT INCLUDES THE PROCUREMENT OF EQUIPMENT FOR BUILDING THE TEST BED. PROPOSED ACTIVITIES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO ADDRESSING ISSUES IDENTIFIED BY THE U.S. NATIONAL QUANTUM INITIATIVE FOR THE NATION TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP IN QIS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGIES.ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED:THIS PROJECT AIMS TO ESTABLISH AN ATOMIC QUBIT RESEARCH TESTBED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES (UCLA) WITHIN A 12-MONTH TIMEFRAME. THE TESTBED WILL COMPRISE LASERS, ELECTRONICS, AND TEST AND MEASUREMENT EQUIPMENT NECESSARY FOR ATOMIC QUBIT EXPERIMENTATION. KEY OBJECTIVES INCLUDE PROCURING EQUIPMENT, COORDINATING INSTALLATION, AND ENSURING THE TESTBED?S READINESS FOR RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.EXPECTED OUTCOME: EXPECTED IMPACTS OF THE PROJECT ARE THE ADVANCEMENT OF QIST, CATALYZING COLLABORATIVE R\u0026D, EXPANDING RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES, S\u0026T BENEFITS TO THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, AND U.S. LEADERSHIP IN QUANTUM COMPUTING. FOR EACH OF THESE IMPACTS, THE PROPOSAL INCLUDES A DESCRIPTION OF HOW OUTCOMES WILL BE IDENTIFIED AND EVALUATED, SUCH AS TRACKING RESEARCH OUTCOMES, TEST BED USAGES, AND INCREASED COLLABORATIONS.
