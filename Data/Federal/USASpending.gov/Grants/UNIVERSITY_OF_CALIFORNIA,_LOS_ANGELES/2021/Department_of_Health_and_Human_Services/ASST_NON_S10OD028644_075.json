    "Description": "NMR CONSOLE AND PRODIGY CRYOPROBE - PROJECT SUMMARY A GROUP OF NIH SUPPORTED INVESTIGATORS REQUESTS FUNDS TO PURCHASE A NMR CRYOPROBE AND UPGRADE THE CONSOLE OF A 600 MHZ NMR SPECTROMETER. THIS EQUIPMENT WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE SIGNAL SENSITIVITY OF AN EXISTING SHARED SPECTROMETER THAT IS HOUSED IN THE NMR LABORATORY OF THE UCLA MOLECULAR INSTRUMENTATION CENTER CORE FACILITY AND BRING HIGH SENSITIVITY NMR DETECTION OF HETERONUCLEI TO THE FACILITY. SPECIFICALLY, WE REQUEST FUNDS TO PURCHASE A BROADBAND BRUKER PRODIGY CRYOPROBE THAT INCREASES NMR SIGNAL SENSITIVITY BY A FACTOR OF 2-4 OVER THE CONVENTIONAL NMR PROBE. ADDITIONALLY, WE REQUEST FUNDS TO REPLACE THE OUTDATED BRUKER AVANCE I NMR CONSOLE THAT WAS INSTALLED IN 2002, WITH AN AVANCE NEO 600 HIGH PERFORMANCE DIGITAL CONSOLE, WHICH IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE NEW CRYOPROBE. THE NEW INSTRUMENTATION IS NOT ONLY EXPECTED TO BE CONSIDERABLY MORE SENSITIVE, BUT ALSO MORE RELIABLE THAN THE EXISTING NMR CONSOLE AND PROBE, AND IT WILL HELP TO RELIEVE THE OVERSATURATION USAGE OF OTHER MAGNETS IN THE FACILITY. THE NEW EQUIPMENT WILL BE MANAGED BY TWO EXPERIENCED PH.D.-LEVEL STAFF SCIENTISTS. ALSO, IF THIS GRANT IS AWARDED, UCLA HAS COMMITTED FUNDS TO PURCHASE A 60X SAMPLE CHANGER TO FURTHER OPTIMIZE THE RESOURCES IN THE FACILITY, INCREASE USAGE CAPACITY, REDUCE THE RISK FOR ACCIDENTAL FAILURE, AND SHOW OUR INSTITUTIONAL COMMITMENT TO EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH SUPPORTED BY STATE-OF-THE-ART INSTRUMENTATION.",
