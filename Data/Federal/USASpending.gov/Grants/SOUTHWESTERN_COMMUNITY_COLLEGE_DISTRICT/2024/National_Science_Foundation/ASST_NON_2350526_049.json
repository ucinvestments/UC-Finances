    "Description": "SOUTHWESTERN COLLEGE MICRO- NANO- TECHNOLOGY TECHNICAL EDUCATION CERTIFICATE PROGRAM -DEVELOPING A WELL-PREPARED WORKFORCE IN MICRO- AND NANO- TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A CRITICAL NATIONAL NEED. MICRO- AND NANO- TECHNOLOGY (MNT) REFERS TO THE INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE TO ENGINEER SYSTEMS ENABLING THE INVESTIGATION AND CONTROL OF MATTER AT THE MICRO- AND NANO-SCALES. SPECIAL EMERGENT PROPERTIES AND BEHAVIORS ALLOW SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS TO CREATE NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES WHEN MATTER IS ENGINEERED AT THESE SCALES. OVER THE LAST FEW DECADES, THERE HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH AND ADVANCEMENT IN THIS FIELD. THIS REVOLUTION WILL CONTINUE TO PROFOUNDLY IMPACT MAJOR TECHNICAL SECTORS SUCH AS ELECTRONICS, ENERGY SECURITY, AND BIOTECHNOLOGY. A STRONG WORKFORCE, SKILLED IN THE FABRICATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF MNT WILL, THEREFORE, ENABLE THE U.S. TO MAINTAIN ITS POSITION AS A GLOBAL LEADER IN THE INNOVATION ECONOMY. PREPARATION OF THIS HIGH-TECH PART OF THE WORKFORCE REQUIRES A CONCERTED EFFORT BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND ACADEMIA AND RELIES ON THOUSANDS OF SKILLED TECHNICIANS TO ENGAGE IN THIS ENDEAVOR. DESPITE THE IMPORTANCE OF MNT IN THE ECONOMY OF THE FUTURE, AUTHENTIC OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS ATTENDING TWO-YEAR COLLEGES TO EFFICIENTLY PREPARE FOR MNT JOBS ARE RARE. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE STRUCTURED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRADITIONAL AND NON-TRADITIONAL TWO-YEAR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO ACQUIRE THE KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ABILITIES THAT WILL COMPETITIVELY PREPARE STUDENTS FOR ENTRY-LEVEL TECHNICAL CAREERS IN MNT-RELATED FIELDS. SPECIFIC PROJECT OBJECTIVES INCLUDE: (1) PROVIDE STUDENTS FROM UNDERREPRESENTED AND ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS WITH A VIABLE PATHWAY TO A CAREER IN A GROWING HIGH-TECH FIELD, (2) DEVELOP A STRUCTURED MENTORING PROGRAM TO MAXIMIZE RETENTION AND COMPLETION, (3) RECRUIT STEM STUDENTS AND MATRICULATING HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS FROM THE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT, (4) ASSESS AND REFINE THE CURRICULUM IN CONSULTATION WITH INDUSTRY, AND (5) DISSEMINATE THE RESULTS OF THIS PROJECT'S PEDAGOGICAL MODEL TO OTHER INSTITUTIONS LOOKING TO START THEIR OWN MNT TECHNICIAN TRAINING PROGRAMS. A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN DIEGO'S STATE-OF-THE-ART NANO3 FACILITY PROVIDES THE NECESSARY VENUE AND EXPERTISE FOR HANDS-ON TRAINING IN NANOMANUFACTURING AND CHARACTERIZATION. AN ON-GOING COLLABORATION WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY MICROELECTRONICS AND NANOMANUFACTURING CONSORTIUM FOR VETERANS WILL BE LEVERAGED TO FURTHER ENHANCE COURSES AND CURRICULUM THROUGHOUT THE PATHWAY. THE INTENT IS THAT GRADUATES HAVE THE NECESSARY TRAINING TO ENTER AN MNT-RELATED CAREER UPON OBTAINING THEIR 2-YEAR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DEGREE, OR IN SOME CASES, AFTER COMPLETING THEIR 8-WEEK SUMMER PRACTICUM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN DIEGO. ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO KNOWLEDGE OF EFFECTIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES TO PREPARE INDIVIDUALS FOR TECHNICIAN AND ENGINEERING PATHWAYS IN THE MNT INDUSTRY. THIS PROJECT IS FUNDED BY THE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT FOCUSES ON THE EDUCATION OF TECHNICIANS FOR THE ADVANCED-TECHNOLOGY FIELDS THAT DRIVE THE NATION'S ECONOMY. THIS AWARD REFLECTS NSF'S STATUTORY MISSION AND HAS BEEN DEEMED WORTHY OF SUPPORT THROUGH EVALUATION USING THE FOUNDATION'S INTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS REVIEW CRITERIA.- SUBAWARDS ARE PLANNED FOR THIS AWARD.",
