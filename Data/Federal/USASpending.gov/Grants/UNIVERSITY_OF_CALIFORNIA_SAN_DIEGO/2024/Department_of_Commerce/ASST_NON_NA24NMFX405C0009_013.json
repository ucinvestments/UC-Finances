    "Description": "PURPOSE:  THIS FUNDING PROVIDES CRITICAL SUPPORT FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA CRUZ (UC SANTA CRUZ) - INSTITUTE OF MARINE SCIENCES (IMS) AND THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE - SOUTHWEST FISHERIES SCIENCE CENTER (SWFSC) COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM. FOR THIS REQUEST, UC SANTA CRUZ-IMS RESEARCHERS WILL WORK WITH SWFSC SCIENTISTS TO CONDUCT RESEARCH THAT WILL BROADEN THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR SUPPORTING THE MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION OF LIVING MARINE RESOURCES. SPECIFICALLY, RESEARCHERS WILL FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING TASKS: 1) ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS FOR CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON AND STEELHEAD; 2) AN EVALUATION OF CURRENT REINTRODUCTION TECHNIQUES FOR SALMON IN CALIFORNIA; 3) INDIVIDUAL-BASED MODELING FOR CA SALMON EARLY MARINE GROWTH AND PREDATION MORTALITY; 4) FUTURE VIABILITY OF THE CALIFORNIA CURRENT FOR SALMON AND STEELHEAD; 5) IMPROVING CHINOOK SALMON MANAGEMENT BY QUANTIFYING DRIVERS OF SALMON DISTRIBUTION BASED ON ECOSYSTEM INFORMATION FROM OCEAN SURVEYS; 6) STEELHEAD AND CHINOOK FORAGING ECOLOGY, LINKS TO THIAMINE DEFICIENCY, AND ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; 7) AN EMPIRICAL ASSESSMENT OF SALMON DYNAMICS AND THEIR PREDICTABILITY; 8) INTEGRATED MODELING/RECOVERY STRATEGY EVALUATION; 9) PACIFIC SALMONID HABITAT RESILIENCE UNDER A CHANGING CLIMATE; 10) UNDERSTANDING ADAPTIVE CAPACITY OF CALIFORNIA SALMON TO CLIMATE-RELATED STRESSORS; AND 11) LANDSCAPE GENOMICS OF CALIFORNIA SALMON AND STEELHEAD. ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE BOTH FIELD AND LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS, MODELING AND COMPUTATIONAL STUDIES AND WILL INVOLVE BOTH MARINE AND FRESHWATER HABITATS AND SPECIES. WHILE MOST RESEARCH WILL BE BIOLOGICAL IN NATURE, THE SPECTRUM OF TOPICS WILL INCLUDE PHYSICAL, CHEMICAL, GEOLOGICAL, AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF MARINE AND FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENTS. RESEARCH IS OFTEN COORDINATED WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS, SUCH AS THE U.S. FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE, U.S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY, BUREAU OF RECLAMATION, ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS, MOSS LANDING MARINE LAB, OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY, OTHER UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CAMPUSES (E.G., SANTA BARBARA AND DAVIS), MONTEREY BAY AQUARIUM RESEARCH INSTITUTE, HOPKINS MARINE STATION, AND CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY CAMPUSES.",
