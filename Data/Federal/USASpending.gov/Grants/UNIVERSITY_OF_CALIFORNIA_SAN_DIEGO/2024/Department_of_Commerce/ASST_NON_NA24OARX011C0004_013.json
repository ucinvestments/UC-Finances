    "Description": "PURPOSE: RESEARCHERS PROPOSE TO CHARACTERIZE THE FAUNAL DIVERSITY OF THREE DEEP-PELAGIC CRUSTACEAN GROUPS FOUND THROUGHOUT THE WATER COLUMN FROM ~200 M TO 2,500 M DEEP WITHIN THE US EEZ OFF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE LABORATORY-BASED STUDY USES EXISTING SAMPLES COLLECTED AT FIVE SITES FROM DEEP BASIN, ESCARPMENT, AND ABYSSAL PLAIN HABITATS. THE PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE THREE BIOMASS-DOMINANT CRUSTACEAN GROUPS FOUND IN THE AREA AT DEPTHS GREATER THAN 1,000 M (DECAPODA, LOPHOGRASTRIDA, AND MYSIDA), WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY IDENTIFYING NEW SPECIES PRESENT IN SAMPLES. THESE CRUSTACEAN GROUPS SERVE AS AN IMPORTANT FOOD SOURCE FOR NUMEROUS PREDATORS AND ARE THEMSELVES KEY COMPONENTS OF THE BIOLOGICAL CARBON PUMP; YET, THEY ARE SEVERELY UNDERREPRESENTED IN SPECIMEN COLLECTIONS AND GENETIC REFERENCE DATABASES SUCH AS THOSE REQUIRED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DNA (EDNA) METHODS. OUTPUTS FROM THE PROJECT INCLUDE VERIFIED DNA AND SPECIMEN REFERENCE LIBRARIES TO SUPPORT FUTURE EXPLORATION OF DEEP-PELAGIC COMMUNITIES WITH METABARCODING (E.G., EDNA) AND MIDWATER TRAWLS, PEER-REVIEWED PUBLICATIONS, AND A FREELY AVAILABLE PICTORIAL GUIDE DOCUMENTING KEY IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS OF DEEP-PELAGIC CRUSTACEANS TO SUPPORT FUTURE EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH.",
