    "Description": "PROJECT EAGER: ENABLING ACCESS TO GENOMICS EXPERIENCE AND RESEARCH - PROJECT SUMMARY PROJECT EAGER IS AN AMBITIOUS COLLABORATIVE INITIATIVE BETWEEN CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY, FULLERTON (CSUF) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY (UCB) THAT WILL GUIDE COHORTS OF CSUF STUDENTS TOWARD GRADUATE PROGRAMS IN GENOMICS. IT RECOGNIZES THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF EFFECTIVE MENTORSHIP, PARTICULARLY DURING THE UNDERGRADUATE YEARS, IN SHAPING ASPIRING SCIENTISTS’ CAREER TRAJECTORIES. WHILE FOCUSING ON UNDERGRADUATE MENTORSHIP AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES, PROJECT EAGER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT CAREER ASPIRATIONS ARE OFTEN FORMED OR ALTERED AT THIS LEVEL, AND RESEARCH EXPERIENCES PLAY A PIVOTAL ROLE. HOWEVER, NOT ALL UNDERGRADUATES HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO SUCH OPPOR- TUNITIES DUE TO DISPARITIES BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. UNDERSERVED INSTITUTIONS TYPICALLY HAVE LIMITED RESEARCH OPTIONS COMPARED TO RESEARCH-INTENSIVE UNIVERSITIES LIKE UCB. ADDITIONALLY, STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, INCLUD- ING UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS, FACE UNIQUE CHALLENGES IN PURSUING STEM CAREERS, INCLUDING LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF GENOMICS OPPORTUNITIES AND SOCIETAL PRESSURES FAVORING TRADITIONAL PATHS.  TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES, PROJECT EAGER EMPLOYS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT INTEGRATES SPECIALIZED COURSEWORK, LABORATORY EXPERIENCES, AND INDIVIDUALIZED MENTORSHIP. YEARLY, EIGHT STUDENTS ARE SELECTED AS COHORTS BASED ON THEIR ACADEMIC RECORDS AND INTEREST IN GENOMICS. THE PROGRAM SPANS MULTIPLE PHASES, STARTING WITH SPECIALIZED CSUF COURSES TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR SUBSEQUENT SUMMER LABORATORY WORK AT UCB. THE CURRICULUM INCLUDES THEORETICAL COURSEWORK CO-TAUGHT BY UCB FACULTY VIA VIRTUAL PLATFORMS, ENSURING A STRONG FOUNDATION IN THE FIELD. ONGOING ENGAGEMENT WITH THE UCB FACULTY MENTORS, INCLUDING VIRTUAL MEETINGS AND CONSULTATIONS, FACILITATES CONTINUOUS MENTORSHIP AND RESEARCH COLLABORATION. THE SECOND SUMMER FOCUSES ON FURTHER RESEARCH AND PROJECT COMPLETION AT UCB.  STUDENTS BENEFIT FROM THE GUIDANCE AND MENTORSHIP OF THE PROJECT EAGER TEAM, COMPRISING PIS FROM CSUF AND UCB, AS WELL AS MENTORS FROM THE UCB LABORATORY AND THE WIDER RESEARCH COMMUNITY. THIS MULTI-FACETED MENTORSHIP APPROACH ENSURES STUDENTS HAVE DIVERSE SUPPORT NETWORKS FOR THEIR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL GROWTH. THE PROGRAM AIMS TO EQUIP STUDENTS WITH THE SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE NEEDED FOR SUCCESS IN GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND GENOMICS CAREERS. PROJECT EAGER ALSO STRIVES TO FOSTER A SUPPORTIVE AND INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENT. BY PROMOTING MENTORSHIP, RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT, AND DIVERSITY, IT EMPOWERS STUDENTS TO REALIZE THEIR POTENTIAL IN GENOMICS. UL- TIMATELY, PROJECT EAGER AIMS TO CULTIVATE A COMMUNITY OF RESEARCHERS PREPARED FOR GRADUATE STUDIES AND CAPABLE OF MAKING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD’S ADVANCEMENT.",
