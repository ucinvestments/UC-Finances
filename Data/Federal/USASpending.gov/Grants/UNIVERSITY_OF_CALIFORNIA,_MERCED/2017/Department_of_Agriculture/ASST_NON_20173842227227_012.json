THE SJV IS ALSO AMONG THE MOST ETHNICALLY AND RACIALLY DIVERSE REGIONS OF CALIFORNIA (AND LIKELY THE NATION). THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF OUR PROPOSAL IS TO MAINTAIN AND ENHANCE THE EXCELLENT MOMENTUM ESTABLISHED IN THE ORIGINAL CYCLE OF OUR USDA HSI PROGRAM AT UC MERCED BY EXPANDING THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF RESEARCH TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES TO THE DIVERSE POPULATION OF STUDENTS SUPPORTED BY UC MERCED AND OUR PARTNER HSIS, CSU STANISLAUS AND UC SANTA CRUZ.AUDIENCE: OUR PROGRAMS TARGET PRIMARILY STUDENTS FROM TRADITIONALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS IN STEM AND THOSE FROM SOCIAL-ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS. IN ADDITION FROM POSITIVELY IMPACTING OUR SCHOLARS, WE WILL ALSO BENEFIT LOCAL SCHOOLS AND THEIR STUDENTS THROUGH OUTREACH OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY IN GENERAL.NUMBER OF SCHOLARS BENEFITING: WHILE WE PROPOSE TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT 15 UNDERGRADUATE AND 10 GRADUATE SCHOLARS, THE BROADER IMPACTS WILL BENEFIT ALL UROC SCHOLARS AND REGIONAL STUDENTS (OVER 300/YR).PRODUCTS: OUR PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS ARE WELL-TRAINED UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE LEVEL SCHOLARS THAT WILL BE HIGHLY QUALIFIED FOR ACADEMIC OR PROFESSIONAL POSITIONS IN AGRICULTURE-RELATED DISCIPLINES.

BASED ON THE FIRST ITERATION OF OUR GRANT WE EXPECT THE FOLLOWING TO CONSTITUTE MOST OF OUR EXPECTED OUTCOMES: (1) INCREASED GRADUATION RATE OF BOTH UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE SCHOLARS COMPARED TO THE NON-SCHOLARS AT EACH INSTITUTION, (2) INCREASED PUBLICATIONS BY BOTH GROUPS, (3) INCREASED CONFERENCEAND MEETING PRESENTATIONS, (4) INCREASED NUMBER OF AWARDS AND HONORS BY BOTH GROUPS, (5) INCREASED NUMBER OF SCHOLARS PURSUING AGRICULTURE-RELATED CAREERS, AND (6) AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET AND DISCUSS CAREER OPPORTUNITIES WITH USDA REPRESENTATIVES AT MEETINGS.",
