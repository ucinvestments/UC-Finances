    "Description": "1.AWARD PURPOSE: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE INVASIVE (FORMERLY EXOTIC) FRUIT FLY STATEWIDE PEST DETECTION SURVEY IS TO FIND INSECT PESTS BEFORE THEY INFEST ONE SQUARE MILE. THIS IS ACHIEVED THROUGH MAINTAINING A TRAPPING NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE TARGET PESTS THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON ARE THE MEXICAN FRUIT FLY (MEXFLY), ANASTREPHA LUDEN; ZEUGODACUS SPP.; BACTROCERA SPP.; AND MEDITERRANEAN FRUIT FLY (MEDFLY), CERATITIS CAPITATA. 2. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE INVASIVE FRUIT FLY SURVEY WILL LOOK FOR THE PRESENCE AND EARLY DETECTION OF A NUMBER OF INVASIVE FRUIT FLY PEST SPECIES. TRAPS WILL BE PLACED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TRAP SITES WILL BE SELECTED AT HIGH-RISK PORTS AND URBAN AND RURAL SETTINGS. SUSPECT SAMPLES WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR CONFIRMATION TO THE PLANT PEST DIAGNOSTICS CENTER (PPDC). THIS STATEWIDE TRAPPING PROGRAM IS OUTLINED IN THE CDFA INSECT TRAPPING GUIDE, AND TRAPS WILL BE SERVICED DEPENDING ON THE TRAP TYPE AND REGION. INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED BY THE EXOTIC FRUIT FLY CROSS-FUNCTIONAL WORKING GROUP, THE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP, THE SCIENCE ADVISORY PANEL AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. DETECTION ENTOMOLOGISTS WILL ROUTINELY CONDUCT QUALITY CONTROL INSPECTIONS TO EVALUATE THE TRAPPING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE PERFORMING AT THE OPTIMAL LEVEL. TRAPPERS WILL BE TRAINED IN TRAP PLACEMENT, PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATION, AND PROPER SAMPLE SUBMISSION PROCEDURES. 3. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: IN 2022 ALONE, THERE WERE 948 INVASIVE FRUIT FLY ADULTS AND 222 LARVAE, REPRESENTING SIX SPECIES TRAPPED IN 15 CALIFORNIA COUNTIES. THESE DETECTIONS TRIGGERED 50 DELIMITATION ONLY TRAPPING PROJECTS, TEN DELIMITATION AND ERADICATION PROJECTS, AND SEVEN QUARANTINE PROJECTS (EIGHT INCLUDING A PROJECT THAT BEGUN IN 2022). HISTORY HAS SHOWN THAT THE HIGHER DENSITY OF TRAPS IN AN AREA INCREASES THE PROBABILITY THAT AN INTRODUCED PEST IS DETECTED EARLY. EARLY DETECTION INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ERADICATING THESE PESTS OF CONCERN. THE SURVEY METHODS DESCRIBED IN THIS DOCUMENT TARGET LIKELY INTRODUCTION POINTS. TARGETING THE SURVEY ON THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST RISK FOR INTRODUCTION SHOULD ALLOW FOR A REASONABLE EXPECTATION FOR THE DETECTION OF INTRODUCTIONS OF THESE PESTS. THEREFORE, THIS SURVEY SHOULD FIND EVIDENCE OF THESE PESTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. A TABULATION OF THE NUMBER OF TRAPS DEPLOYED AND THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES SUBMITTED CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE IF THE SURVEY EFFORTS WERE SUFFICIENT. NEGATIVE SURVEY RESULTS WOULD INDICATE THAT THESE PESTS HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED NOR ESTABLISHED IN CALIFORNIA. 4. INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES): INVASIVE FRUIT FLIES (DIPTERA: TEPHRITIDAE), SUCH AS MEDFLY AND ORIENTAL FRUIT FLY, ARE AMONG THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO CALIFORNIA’S $51.1 BILLION AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. THESE PESTS ARE HIGHLY POLYPHAGOUS, CAPABLE OF BREEDING IN OVER 400 SPECIES OF FRUITS, NUTS, AND VEGETABLES; MANY OF WHICH ARE ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT SPECIALTY CROPS FOR CALIFORNIA AND THE UNITED STATES. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY OF THESE FRUIT FLIES WOULD HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMIC WELLNESS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION, REQUIRING EXTENSIVE USE OF PESTICIDES, BOTH IN URBAN AND COMMERCIAL SETTINGS. THE RESULTING QUARANTINES AGAINST EXPORTED CALIFORNIA GROWN COMMODITIES WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE INTERNATIONAL EXPORT TRADE ARENA. 5. SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES, IF KNOWN OR SPECIFIED AT THE TIME OF AWARD: COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS (CAC) WILL MAINTAIN AND OPERATE FRUIT FLY TRAPS, PROVIDE SURVEY SITE INFORMATION, ASSIST WITH THE SURVEY, AND SUBMIT SPECIMENS FOR IDENTIFICATION (SEE ATTACHMENT B). THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT (OEHHA), UC DAVIS MEDICAL AND A HAZARDOUS WASTE HAULER WILL ALSO RECEIVE FUNDING.",
