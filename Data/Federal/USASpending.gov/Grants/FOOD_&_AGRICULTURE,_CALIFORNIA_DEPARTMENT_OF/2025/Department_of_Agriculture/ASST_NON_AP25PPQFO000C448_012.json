    "Description": "AWARD PURPOSE: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE INVASIVE FRUIT FLY (IFF) STATEWIDE PEST DETECTION SURVEY IS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES, ACCESS TO FRESH PRODUCE WITHIN THE ENTIRE US AND TO RETAIN AND EXPAND EXPORT MARKETS BY DEMONSTRATING THE ABSENCE OF A PEST, OR “PEST FREE AREAS,” FOR EXPORT CERTIFICATION PURPOSES. THIS IS ACHIEVED THROUGH MAINTAINING A TRAPPING NETWORK THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE TARGET PESTS THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL FOCUS ON ARE THE ANASTREPHA SPP.; ZEUGODACUS SPP.; BACTROCERA SPP.; AND THE MEDITERRANEAN FRUIT FLY (MEDFLY). ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED: THE INVASIVE FRUIT FLY SURVEY WILL LOOK FOR THE PRESENCE AND EARLY DETECTION OF A NUMBER OF INVASIVE FRUIT FLY PEST SPECIES. TRAPS WILL BE PLACED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN 47 COUNTIES. TRAP SITES WILL BE SELECTED AT HIGH-HAZARD INTERNATIONAL PORTS OF ENTRY, AND SURROUNDING URBAN, RURAL AND FOREST AREAS. SUSPECT SAMPLES WILL BE SUBMITTED FOR CONFIRMATION TO THE PLANT PEST DIAGNOSTICS CENTER (PPDC). THIS STATEWIDE TRAPPING PROGRAM IS OUTLINED IN THE CDFA INSECT TRAPPING GUIDE, AND TRAPS WILL BE SERVICED DEPENDING ON THE TRAP TYPE AND REGION. INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE WILL ALSO BE PROVIDED BY THE EXOTIC FRUIT FLY CROSS-FUNCTIONAL WORKING GROUP, THE TECHNICAL WORKING GROUP, THE SCIENCE ADVISORY PANEL AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. TRAPPERS WILL BE TRAINED IN TRAP PLACEMENT, PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATION, AND PROPER SAMPLE SUBMISSION PROCEDURES. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES: BETWEEN 2020-2024 ALONE, 1,273 IFF WERE DETECTED IN CALIFORNIA. THESE DETECTIONS RESULTED IN AN AVERAGE OF 39 DELIMITATION-TRAPPING PROGRAMS AND 3 QUARANTINES PER YEAR. DURING 2024, CDFA TRAPPED 139 ADULT IFF FROM SEVEN IFF SPECIES IN EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES. THESE DETECTIONS TRIGGERED 29 DELIMITATION-TRAPPING PROGRAMS, THREE ERADICATION-ONLY PROJECTS, AND TWO QUARANTINE PROJECTS. THESE DETECTIONS DEMONSTRATE THAT INFESTED COMMODITIES ARE FINDING THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA AND COOPERATIVE INTERAGENCY PEST SURVEILLANCE AND ERADICATION PROJECTS ARE REQUIRED. THE SURVEY METHODS DESCRIBED IN THIS DOCUMENT TARGET LIKELY INTRODUCTION POINTS. TARGETING THE SURVEY ON THOSE AREAS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST RISK FOR INTRODUCTION SHOULD ALLOW FOR A REASONABLE EXPECTATION FOR THE DETECTION OF INTRODUCTIONS OF THESE PESTS. THEREFORE, THIS SURVEY SHOULD FIND EVIDENCE OF THESE PESTS IF THEY HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED. A TABULATION OF THE NUMBER OF SITES TRAPPED AND SAMPLED AND THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES SUBMITTED CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE IF THE SURVEY EFFORTS WERE SUFFIC IENT. NEGATIVE SURVEY RESULTS WOULD INDICATE THAT THESE PESTS HAVE NOT BEEN INTRODUCED NOR ESTABLISHED IN CALIFORNIA. INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES): INVASIVE FRUIT FLIES (DIPTERA: TEPHRITIDAE), INCLUDING MEDFLY AND ORIENTAL FRUIT FLY, ARE AMONG THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO CALIFORNIA’S $59.4 BILLION AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ANY OF THESE FRUIT FLIES WOULD HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMIC WELLNESS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION, REQUIRING EXTENSIVE USE OF PESTICIDES, BOTH IN URBAN AND COMMERCIAL SETTINGS. THE RESULTING QUARANTINES AGAINST EXPORTED CALIFORNIA GROWN COMMODITIES WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE INTERNATIONAL EXPORT TRADE ARENA.  SUBRECIPIENT ACTIVITIES, IF KNOWN OR SPECIFIED AT THE TIME OF AWARD: COUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONERS (CAC) WILL MAINTAIN AND OPERATE FRUIT FLY TRAPS, PROVIDE SURVEY SITE INFORMATION, ASSIST WITH THE SURVEY, AND SUBMIT SPECIMENS FOR IDENTIFICATION (SEE ATTACHMENT B). THE COOPERATIVE AGRICULTURAL SUPPORT SERVICES (CASS), CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION CORPS (CCC), CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL (CHP), DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATIONS (DPR), HAZARDOUS WASTE REMOVAL AND PORTABLE TOILETS, OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT (OEHHA), UC DAVIS MEDICAL, AND VEHICLE RENTAL CONTRACTS WILL ALSO RECEIVE FUNDING.",
