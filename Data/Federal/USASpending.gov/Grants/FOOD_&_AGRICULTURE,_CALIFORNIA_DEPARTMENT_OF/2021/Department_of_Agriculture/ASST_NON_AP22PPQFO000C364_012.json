AWARD PURPOSE:TO PREVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ORIENTAL FRUIT FLY (OFF), BACTROCERADORSALIS (HENDEL), THE CDFA HAS INITIATED AN ERADICATION PROJECT INRESPONSE TO THE DETECTION OF SEVEN ADULT OFFS IN THE SAN JOSE AREA,SANTA CLARA COUNTY – 115 SQUARE MILES IN SIZE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS AWARDIS TO CONDUCT TRAPPING DELIMITATION ARRAY, ERADICATION TREATMENTS(INSECTICIDE TREATMENTS AND FRUIT REMOVAL) AND QUARANTINE ENFORCEMENTAROUND THE OFF DETECTION SITES, AND TO CONTINUE EARLY DETECTION OF NEWOFF INFESTATIONS.2. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED:DELIMITATION TRAPPING WITH JACKSON AND MCPHAIL TRAPS WILL OCCUR OVER 99SQUARE MILES. FOLIAR BAIT TREATMENTS (GROUND) WILL TAKE PLACE OVER 200METERS AROUND ALL ADULT DETECTION SITES FOR ONE LIFE CYCLE BEYOND THELAST FLY DETECTED. GROUND BAIT SPRAY CONTAINING SPINOSAD WILL BE APPLIEDTO ALL PROPERTIES WITHIN A 200-METER RADIUS OF EACH FLY DETECTION SITEFOR ONE LIFECYCLE, REPEATED EVERY SEVEN TO 14 DAYS. MALE ATTRACTANTTREATMENT (MAT) WILL HAVE 600 BAIT STATIONS APPLIED TO INANIMATE OBJECTSEVERY TWO WEEKS THROUGHOUT A NINE SQUARE MILE AREA AROUND EACH DETECTIONSITE. TREATMENTS WILL CONTINUE FOR TWO LIFE CYCLES BEYOND THE LAST FLYDETECTED. LARVAL SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED OVER 200 METERS AROUND ALLDETECTION SITES. IF LARVAE, A MATED FEMALE, OR MULTIPLE ADULT FLIES AREFOUND AT A PROPERTY, HOST FRUIT WILL BE REMOVED. QUARANTINE WORK WILL BEDONE TO REGULATE THE MOVEMENT OF HOST MATERIAL, INCLUDING ISSUING COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS AND HOLD NOTICES. INTENSIVE POST-TREATMENT TRAPPING WILL OCCUR FOR THREE LIFECYCLES AFTER THE LAST FLY ISDETECTED. THE TRAPPING AND SURVEY CREW WILL BE TRAINED IN TRAPPLACEMENT, PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATION, ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, LAWSAND REGULATIONS, AND PROPER SAMPLE SUBMISSION PROCEDURES.

DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES:THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DETECTION, TREATMENT, ANDQUARANTINE ACTIVITIES WILL ERADICATE THE OFF FROM CALIFORNIA. INTENSIVEPOST-TREATMENT TRAPPING WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT AREASFOR THREE LIFE CYCLES AFTER THE LAST FLY IS DETECTED. THIS HIGH LEVEL OFTRAPPING WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM. A TABULATIONOF THE NUMBER OF SITES SAMPLED AND THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE SAMPLESSUBMITTED CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE IF THE SURVEY EFFORTS WERESUFFICIENT. IF NO ADDITIONAL OFFS ARE DETECTED, THE PROJECT WILL BETERMINATED, AND THE QUARANTINE LIFTED.4. INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES):THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFF WOULD HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THEENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMIC WELLNESS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION. OFF INCALIFORNIA WOULD REQUIRE EXTENSIVE USE OF PESTICIDES BOTH IN URBAN ANDCOMMERCIAL SETTINGS. THE RESULTING QUARANTINES AGAINST EXPORTEDCALIFORNIA GROWN COMMODITIES WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ONCALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE INTERNATIONAL EXPORT TRADE ARENA.THESE INFESTATIONS POSE A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES'AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, AND PARTICULARLY TO CALIFORNIA'S $50 BILLIONAGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY.5.
