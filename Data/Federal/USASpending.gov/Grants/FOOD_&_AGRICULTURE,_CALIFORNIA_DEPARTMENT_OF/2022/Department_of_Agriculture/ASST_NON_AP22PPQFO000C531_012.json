    "Description": "1. AWARD PURPOSE:TO PREVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MEXICAN FRUIT FLY (MEXFLY), ANASTREPHALUDENS (LOEW), THE CDFA HAS INITIATED AN ERADICATION PROJECT IN RESPONSETO THE DETECTION OF SIX ADULT AND ONE LARVA MEXFLIES IN THE VALLEYCENTER AREA OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY – 77 SQUARE MILES IN SIZE. THE PURPOSEOF THIS AWARD IS TO CONDUCT TRAPPING DELIMITATION ARRAY, ERADICATIONTREATMENTS (STERILE INSECT TECHNIQUE, INSECTICIDE TREATMENTS AND FRUITREMOVAL) AND QUARANTINE ENFORCEMENT AROUND THE MEXFLY DETECTION SITES,AND TO CONTINUE EARLY DETECTION OF NEW MEXFLY INFESTATIONS.2. ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED:DELIMITATION TRAPPING WITH MCPHAIL TRAPS WILL OCCUR OVER 90 SQUAREMILES. FOLIAR BAIT TREATMENTS (GROUND) WILL TAKE PLACE OVER 200 METERSAROUND ALL ADULT DETECTION SITES FOR ONE LIFE CYCLE BEYOND THE LAST FLYDETECTED. GROUND BAIT SPRAY CONTAINING SPINOSAD WILL BE APPLIED TO ALLPROPERTIES WITHIN A 200-METER RADIUS OF EACH FLY AND LARVAL DETECTIONSITE FOR ONE LIFECYCLE, REPEATED EVERY SEVEN TO 14 DAYS. STERILE INSECTTECHNIQUE (SIT) WILL BE UTILIZED TO DEPLOY 250,000 STERILE MALE MEXFLIESEACH WEEK; RELEASED VIA AIRCRAFT IN A 43 SQUARE MILE AREA (3.5-MILERADIUS AROUND EACH DETECTION SITE, EXCEPT MOUNTAINOUS AREAS WITH NO HOSTMATERIAL). RELEASE WILL CONTINUE FOR TWO LIFE CYCLES BEYOND THE LAST FLYDETECTED. LARVAL SURVEY WILL BE CONDUCTED OVER 200 METERS AROUND ALLDETECTION SITES. IF LARVAE, A MATED FEMALE, EGGS, OR MULTIPLE ADULTFLIES ARE FOUND AT A PROPERTY, HOST FRUIT WILL BE REMOVED 100 METERSAROUND THE DETECTION SITE. QUARANTINE WORK WILL BE DONE TO REGULATE THEMOVEMENT OF HOST MATERIAL, INCLUDING ISSUING COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS ANDHOLD NOTICES. INTENSIVE POST-TREATMENT TRAPPING WILL OCCUR FOR THREELIFECYCLES AFTER THE LAST FLY IS DETECTED. THE TRAPPING AND SURVEY CREWWILL BE TRAINED IN TRAP PLACEMENT, PRELIMINARY IDENTIFICATION, TREATMENTSAFETY, ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS, AND PROPERSAMPLE SUBMISSION PROCEDURES. SAMPLES WILL BE SENT TO THE PLANT PESTDIAGNOSTICS CENTER(PPDC) FOR IDENTIFICATION. THE QUARANTINE ANDREGULATED AREA ACTIVITIES WILL BE PERFORMED BY THE USDA, CDFA, ANDCOUNTY AGRICULTURAL COMMISSIONER’S (CAC) STAFF.3. DELIVERABLES AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES:THE SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DETECTION, TREATMENT, ANDQUARANTINE ACTIVITIES WILL ERADICATE THE MEXFLY FROM CALIFORNIA. INTENSIVE POST-TREATMENT TRAPPING WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE PROJECT AREAS FOR THREE LIFE CYCLES AFTER THE LAST FLY IS DETECTED.THIS HIGH LEVEL OF TRAPPING WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEPROGRAM. A TABULATION OF THE NUMBER OF SITES SAMPLED AND THE NUMBER OFPOSITIVE SAMPLES SUBMITTED CAN BE USED TO DETERMINE IF THE SURVEYEFFORTS WERE SUFFICIENT. IF NO ADDITIONAL MEXFLIES ARE DETECTED, THEPROJECT WILL BE TERMINATED, AND THE QUARANTINE LIFTED.4. INTENDED BENEFICIARY(IES):THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE MEXFLY WOULD HAVE A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THEENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMIC WELLNESS OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION. MEXFLYIN CALIFORNIA WOULD REQUIRE EXTENSIVE USE OF PESTICIDES BOTH IN URBANAND COMMERCIAL SETTINGS. THE RESULTING QUARANTINES AGAINST EXPORTEDCALIFORNIA GROWN COMMODITIES WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE IMPACT ONCALIFORNIA'S ABILITY TO COMPETE IN THE INTERNATIONAL EXPORT TRADE ARENA.THESE INFESTATIONS POSE A SERIOUS THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES'AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY, AND PARTICULARLY TO CALIFORNIA'S $50 BILLIONAGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY.5.
