THE TEAM WILL ALSO COLLECT NEW SAMPLES FROM FARMS IN CALIFORNIA AND IOWA TO CONTINUE STUDYING THESE TRENDS. THEY WILL USE BOTH LAB-BASED AND ADVANCED DNA SEQUENCING METHODS TO CHECK FOR ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT E. COLI, A HARMFUL BACTERIA.THE PROJECT WILL ALSO TEST NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR TREATING MANURE ON EIGHT DIFFERENT DAIRIES TO SEE HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE AT REMOVING RESISTANT BACTERIA. FINALLY, THE RESEARCHERS WILL USE A MODEL TO ESTIMATE HOW THESE BACTERIA COULD AFFECT BOTH FARMERS AND CONSUMERS.THE ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE HOW ANTIBIOTICS ARE USED ON FARMS AND HELP REDUCE THE SPREAD OF ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE, CONTRIBUTING TO THE GLOBAL FIGHT AGAINST THIS GROWING HEALTH THREAT.",
