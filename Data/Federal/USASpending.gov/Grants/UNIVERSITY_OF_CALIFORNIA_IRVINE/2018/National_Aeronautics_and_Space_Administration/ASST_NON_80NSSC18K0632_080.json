WE WILL EMPLOY OUR PROVEN TECHNIQUE COMBINING WHOLE AIR SAMPLING (WAS) WITH GAS CHROMATOGRAPHY (ECD/FID/MSD/RGD) TO PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY MEASUREMENTS OF 60-70 TRACE GASES. THESE INCLUDE C2-C10 NONMETHANE HYDROCARBONS (NMHCS)  WHICH ARE PRIORITY 1 IN THE WHITE PAPER; C1-C5 ALKYL NITRATES (RONO2) (PRIORITY 2); HALOCARBONS (PRIORITY 3); AND SULFUR COMPOUNDS AND H2. IN ADDITION  WE WILL SHARE SUB-SAMPLES WITH DIFFERENT LABORATORIES FOR ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS (SEE BELOW) AND WE PROPOSE TO PROVIDE BACK-UP CAPABILITY FOR THE IN SITU CO AND CH4 MEASUREMENTS  WHICH HAS PROVEN VERY VALUABLE DURING PREVIOUS MISSIONS. WE WILL COLLECT UP TO 168 AIR SAMPLES PER FLIGHT  AND WE CAN MAINTAIN THE REQUIRED TIME RESOLUTION OF 1 MINUTE FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF  BUT NOT THE ENTIRE FLIGHT. HOWEVER  OUR FLEXIBLE SAMPLING PROTOCOL ALLOWS US TO QUICKLY RESPOND TO IN-FLIGHT SAMPLING REQUESTS FROM THE SCIENCE TEAM. ALL DATA WILL BE SUBMITTED TO THE NASA LARC ARCHIVE.",
