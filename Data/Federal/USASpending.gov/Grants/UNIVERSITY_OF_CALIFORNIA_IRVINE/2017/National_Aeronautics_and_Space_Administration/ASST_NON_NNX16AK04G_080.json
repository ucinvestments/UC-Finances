    "Description": "SUMMARY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA  IRVINE (UCI) HAS MONITORED GLOBAL TRACE GAS CONCENTRATIONS SINCE 1978  WITH FUNDING SUPPORT FROM NASA SINCE 1984. THE PROGRAM TARGETS COMPOUNDS THAT IMPACT THE ATMOSPHERE S CHEMISTRY AND RADIATIVE FORCING  INCLUDING GREENHOUSE GASES (E.G.  CH4)  STRATOSPHERIC OZONE DEPLETING AGENTS (E.G.  CFCS  CH3CCL3)  LIGHT HYDROCARBONS (E.G.  ETHANE  PROPANE)  INDUSTRIAL SOLVENTS (E.G.  C2CL4  CHCL3)  CARBON MONOXIDE (CO)  AND LIGHT ORGANIC NITRATES (E.G.  MEONO2  ETONO2). THE MULTI-DECADE MEASUREMENTS OF LIGHT HYDROCARBONS ARE UNIQUE TO THE UCI GLOBAL MONITORING NETWORK  AS ARE LONG-TERM MEASUREMENTS OF ALKYL NITRATES AND C2CL4. THE UCI DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE COMMUNITY VIA THE CARBON DIOXIDE INFORMATION ANALYSIS CENTER (CDIAC) ARCHIVE AND THE GLOBAL ATMOSPHERIC WATCH (GAW) WORLD DATA CENTER FOR GREENHOUSE GASES (WDCGG). THE UCI DATA ARE REGULARLY USED IN INTERNATIONAL REPORTS  MOST RECENTLY THE 2013 ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (HARTMANN ET AL.  2013) AND THE 2014 SCIENTIFIC ASSESSMENT OF OZONE DEPLETION (CARPENTER AND REIMANN  2014). UCI S LONG-TERM GLOBAL ETHANE DATA HAVE BEEN USED BY SEVERAL GROUPS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY THE GLOBAL GROWTH RATE OF ATMOSPHERIC CH4 HAS DECLINED IN THE LONG TERM (AYDIN ET AL.  2011; KAI ET AL.  2011; SIMPSON ET AL.  2012; KIRSCHKE ET AL.  2013). THE ETHANE DATA HAVE ALSO BEEN USED BY MODELING GROUPS FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES  INCLUDING NOAA (TO INVESTIGATE LONG-TERM GLOBAL CH4 AND ETHANE TRENDS; SIMPSON ET AL.  2012)  CARNEGIE MELLON (TO QUANTIFY FUGITIVE EMISSION RATES OF NATURAL GAS; SCHWIETZKE ET AL.  2014)  AND MAX PLANCK (TO CONSTRAIN CH4 EMISSIONS FROM TROPICAL WETLANDS; NU EZ ET AL.  2015). UCI S GLOBAL DATA SET IS CURRENTLY BEING USED BY THE NCAR MODELING COMMUNITY AS PART OF THE IGAC/SPARC CHEMISTRY CLIMATE MODEL INITIATIVE (CCMI)  BY THE MODELING COMMUNITY AT FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY (FSU) TO INVESTIGATE GEOGENIC ETHANE EMISSIONS  AND BY NOAA/INSTAAR TO CONSTRAIN RECENT ETHANE AND PROPANE TRENDS. OUR BROAD GOALS FOR THE UPCOMING 2016-2021 FUNDING PERIOD ARE TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR KEY CONSTITUENTS OF THE EARTH S ATMOSPHERE  COLLABORATE WITH THE BROADER RESEARCH COMMUNITY  AND ARCHIVE  PUBLISH AND DISSEMINATE OUR MAJOR FINDINGS. OUR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: (1) CONTINUED SEASONAL AIR SAMPLING IN REMOTE REGIONS OF THE PACIFIC BASIN. AS WE HAVE DONE FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS  WE WILL CONTINUE TO COLLECT 60-80 GROUND-LEVEL WHOLE AIR SAMPLES AT 40-50 REMOTE SITES IN A GLOBAL LATITUDINAL TRANSECT THE PACIFIC BASIN (71 N TO 47 S). EACH AIR SAMPLE WILL BE RETURNED TO UCI AND ANALYZED FOR UP TO 55 COMPOUNDS  WITH 16 VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUNDS (VOCS) SUBMITTED TO THE CDIAC AND WDCGG DATA ARCHIVES. (2) CONTINUED PUBLICATION. THE JOURNAL ELEMENTA HAS LAUNCHED A GAW SPECIAL FEATURE ENTITLED REACTIVE GASES IN THE GLOBAL ATMOSPHERE. FOLLOWING OUR RECENT DATA SUBMISSION TO THE GAW WDCGG ARCHIVE  WE PROPOSE TO SUBMIT AN OVERVIEW PAPER SUMMARIZING THE UCI NETWORK AND PRESENTING OUR GLOBAL DATA FOR THE ARCHIVED TRACE GASES. OTHER FINDINGS WILL BE PUBLISHED THROUGHOUT THE 2016-2021 FUNDING PERIOD IN COLLABORATION WITH OUR COLLEAGUES. (3) ON-GOING COLLABORATIONS. OUR LONG-TERM GLOBAL ETHANE DATA ARE PARTICULARLY VALUABLE TO MODELERS AND TO OTHER EXPERIMENTALISTS  ESPECIALLY TOWARDS EFFORTS TO CONSTRAIN SOURCES AND TRENDS OF ATMOSPHERIC CH4. WE WILL CONTINUE THESE COLLABORATIONS DURING 2016-2021. (4) QUANTIFICATION OF H2 USING A NEW REDUCED GAS DETECTOR. MOLECULAR HYDROGEN (H2) CONTRIBUTES TO STRATOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR AND THE HOX CYCLE. WE RECENTLY ACQUIRED A DETECTOR FOR H2 ANALYSIS AND WE HAVE MEASURED A WELL-DEFINED INTERHEMISPHERIC GRADIENT FOR H2. WE WILL INCORPORATE GLOBAL H2 MEASUREMENTS INTO OUR ROUTINE GLOBAL MONITORING.",
