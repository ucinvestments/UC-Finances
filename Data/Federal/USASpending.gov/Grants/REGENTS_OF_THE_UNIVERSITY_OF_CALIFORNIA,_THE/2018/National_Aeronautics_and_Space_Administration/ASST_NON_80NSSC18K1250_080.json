    "Description": "HARD X-RAYS (HXRS) FROM BREMSSTRAHLUNG ARE THE MOST DIRECT AVAILABLE DIAGNOSTIC OF SOLAR FLARE ELECTRON ACCELERATION. THIS ACCELERATION IS THOUGHT TO OCCUR AS A TRANSFER OF ENERGY FROM THE MAGNETIC FIELDS OF THE SOLAR CORONA INTO ENERGETIC PARTICLES  THOUGH THE EXACT NATURE OF THE ACCELERATION IS NOT UNDERSTOOD. TO INVESTIGATE FLARE PARTICLE ACCELERATION  INNOVATIVE NEW INSTRUMENTS WILL FLY ON CUBESATS AND OTHER PLATFORMS TO OBSERVE THE SUN. THESE INSTRUMENTS WILL REQUIRE DETECTORS SENSITIVE TO X-RAYS UP TO ~100 KEV WITH AN ENERGY RESOLUTION OF A FEW KEV OR BETTER  AND WITH LOW BACKGROUND RATES. CADMIUM TELLURIDE (CDTE) IS AN ATTRACTIVE MATERIAL FOR THESE PURPOSES BECAUSE IT CAN TYPICALLY BE OPERATED AT TEMPERATURES REQUIRING ONLY PASSIVE COOLING. THIS IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE FOR CUBESATS THAT DON T HAVE ROOM FOR MECHANICAL COOLERS OR CONSUMABLES.  THIS PROPOSAL DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF THE HXR IMAGER DETECTOR ASSEMBLY BASED ON THE MEDIPIX/TIMEPIX DETECTORS. THE MEDIPIX IS A FAMILY OF PHOTON COUNTING AND PARTICLE TRACKING DETECTORS DEVELOPED BY THE MEDIPIX COLLABORATION AND DESIGNED BY THE MICROELECTRONICS GROUP AT CERN. EACH OF THESE DETECTORS HAVE 256 256 PIXELS WITH A PIXEL SIZE OF 55 M SQUARE WITH A TOTAL AREA OF 14.08MM   14.08MM. WE WILL BUMP-BOND 4 CDTE DIODE ARRAYS TO 4 READOUTS FORMING AN ARRAY OF 2X2. IN ADDITION TO DESIGNING AND FABRICATING THE ARRAY  WE WILL TEST AND CHARACTERIZE THESE DETECTORS IN THE RANGE OF 3 100 KEV FOR APPLICATIONS IN SPACE AND SOLAR ASTROPHYSICS.",
