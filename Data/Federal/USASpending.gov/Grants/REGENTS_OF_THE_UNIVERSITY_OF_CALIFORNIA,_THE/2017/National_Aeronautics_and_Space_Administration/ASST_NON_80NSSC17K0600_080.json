FEW HIGH-TRL INSTRUMENTS EXIST THAT CAN ACHIEVE THIS IMPORTANT GOAL. THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE ENCELADUS ORGANIC ANALYZER (EOA) TO TRL 6 WILL ENABLE A POWERFUL NEW APPROACH FOR CHARACTERIZING CARBON CHEMISTRY IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM INCLUDING THE NON-STATISTICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC MOLECULES AND OPTICAL ISOMERS THAT TELL US ABOUT THE PRESENCE OF EXTANT OR EXTINCT LIFE. EOA IS AN INNOVATIVE MICROCHIP CAPILLARY ELECTROPHORESIS ( CE) SYSTEM WITH LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE (LIF) DETECTION. THE  CE ELECTROPHORETICALLY SEPARATES MOLECULES WITH HIGH RESOLUTION  AND IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR ANALYSIS OF ORGANICS HAVING A WIDE RANGE OF SIZES AND COMPLEXITY FROM A VARIETY OF SOLID  ICE OR LIQUID SOURCES. THE INTEGRATED PROGRAMMABLE MICROFLUIDIC ANALYZER (PMA) ENABLES RELIABLE  FLEXIBLE FLUIDIC PROCESSING. LIF IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE WITH PICOMOLAR CONCENTRATION LIMITS OF DETECTION (THE EQUIVALENT OF ONLY ATTOMOLES DETECTED).",
