    "Description": "WE PROPOSE TO CONTINUE TO PROCESS AND/OR ARCHIVE WHOLE AIR SAMPLES COLLECTED FROM AIRCRAFT AND BALLOON FLIGHTS DURING UPCOMING NASA MISSIONS AND FLIGHTS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR MEASUREMENTS OF THE ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS OF CHEMICALLY AND/OR RADIATIVELY IMPORTANT TRACE GASES  INCLUDING CARBON DIOXIDE AND NITROUS OXIDE. THE ISOTOPE MEASUREMENTS AND THEIR ANALYSIS WILL ALLOW CONTINUED MONITORING OF ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION AND TRANSPORT PROCESSES IN THE STRATOSPHERE AND UPPER TROPOSPHERE OVER THE NEXT 4 YEARS  FOLLOWING ON OUR MEASUREMENTS NOW DATING BACK TO NASA SUBORBITAL FLIGHTS IN 1996-1997.

INSIGHTS AND CONSTRAINTS FOR CHEMISTRY-CLIMATE MODELS WILL ALSO BE GAINED AND ENABLE BETTER PREDICTION OF HOW THESE PROCESSES MAY HAVE CHANGED IN THE PAST AND HOW THEY MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE  WITH APPLICATIONS TO BETTER PREDICTING THE RECOVERY OF THE OZONE LAYER  GREENHOUSE GAS LEVELS  AND FEEDBACKS BETWEEN THEM. OVERALL  THESE MEASUREMENTS AND ANALYSES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE STRATEGIC GOALS OF THIS SOLICITATION AND TO NASA EARTH SCIENCE GOALS IN GENERAL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND MONITOR ATMOSPHERIC COMPOSITION  FEEDBACKS WITH CLIMATE  AND HOW THESE MAY BE CHANGING OVER TIME.",
