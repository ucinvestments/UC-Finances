MOAB LEVERAGES 20 YEARS OF MICROFLUIDIC ORGANIC ANALYZER DEVELOPMENT AT UC BERKELEY  SPANNING PIONEERING WORK IN CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING AND LATER JOINED BY SPACE SCIENCES LAB DEVELOPMENTS TO ACHIEVE TRL 6 FOR ALL SYSTEMS BY 2021. MOAB WILL DETECT AND CHARACTERIZE ORGANIC INDICATIONS OF PAST OR PRESENT LIFE BY DETERMINING THE IDENTITY  ABUNDANCE AND PATTERNS OF AMINES  AMINO ACIDS AND CARBOXYLIC ACIDS (INVESTIGATION 1A1) WITH A DETECTION LIMIT OF 1 PICOMOLE/GRAM OF SAMPLE  OR BETTER. MOAB WILL DETECT AND IDENTIFY ABIOTIC  BIOTIC AND PROTEINOGENIC AMINO ACIDS AT CONCENTRATIONS AS LOW AS 0.2 NM (0.02 PPB) AND QUANTITATE THEIR ABUNDANCE RELATIVE TO GLYCINE. MOAB WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE CHIRAL ENANTIOMERIC EXCESS OF AMINO ACIDS THAT ARE DETECTED TO AN ACCURACY OF 2% THEREBY FULFILLING ALL MEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS OF INVESTIGATION 1A2.",
