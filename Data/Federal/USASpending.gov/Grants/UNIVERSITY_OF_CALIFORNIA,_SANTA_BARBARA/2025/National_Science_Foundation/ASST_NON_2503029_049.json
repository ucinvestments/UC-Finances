    "Description": "CC* STORAGE-CAMPUS: ESTABLISHMENT OF A UC SANTA BARBARA DATA STORAGE HARNESSING OPEN RESEARCH ENVIRONMENTS (DATASHORE) -THE UC SANTA BARBARA DATA STORAGE HARNESSING OPEN ENVIRONMENT (DATASHORE), IS A COMPREHENSIVE CAMPUS-WIDE DATA STORAGE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ADDRESSES CRITICAL CHALLENGES IN COMPUTING-INTENSIVE RESEARCH: INCREASING DATA VOLUME, ACCELERATING DATA VELOCITY, AND THE NEED FOR ENHANCED DATA VISIBILITY. DATASHORE IMPLEMENTS A TIERED STORAGE SYSTEM WITH OVER 10 PETABYTES OF RAW STORAGE CAPACITY, DELIVERING MORE THAN 5 PETABYTES OF USABLE STORAGE FOR SCIENTIFIC APPLICATIONS. THE SYSTEM ENHANCES CAMPUS RESEARCH CAPABILITIES BY INTEGRATING WITH THE NATIONAL RESEARCH PLATFORM THROUGH 100 GBPS NETWORK UPGRADES, FACILITATING RAPID DATA TRANSFER WITHIN CAMPUS AND WITH EXTERNAL COLLABORATORS. DATASHORE SERVES AS BOTH A HOST AND PROVIDER FOR THE OPEN SCIENCE DATA FEDERATION (OSDF), ALLOCATING 25% OF ITS CAPACITY TO THIS NATIONAL NETWORK. THIS DUAL ROLE ENABLES UC SANTA BARBARA RESEARCHERS TO SHARE THEIR DATASETS NATIONALLY WHILE ALSO PROVIDING THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY WITH EFFICIENT ACCESS TO EXTERNAL SCIENTIFIC DATA RESOURCES THROUGH THE OSDF'S DISTRIBUTED ARCHITECTURE. DATASHORE EMPLOYS INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO DATA MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING INTELLIGENT DATA MIGRATION BETWEEN STORAGE TIERS BASED ON USAGE PATTERNS, AUTOMATED ASSESSMENT OF DATA QUALITY AND FAIRNESS (FINDABLE, ACCESSIBLE, INTEROPERABLE, REUSABLE), AND INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING CAMPUS CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE. THE PROJECT INCLUDES A STRUCTURED TRAINING PROGRAM TO DEVELOP RESEARCHER SKILLS IN DATA MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE RESEARCH LIFECYCLE. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE SUPPORTS DIVERSE SCIENTIFIC DOMAINS INCLUDING EPIGENOMICS, ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE, ECOLOGY, FOREST MODELING, AND MATERIALS SCIENCE. BY CREATING A CENTRALIZED, HIGH-PERFORMANCE STORAGE SOLUTION WITH BUILT-IN DATA MANAGEMENT CAPABILITIES, DATASHORE DEMOCRATIZES ACCESS TO ADVANCED CYBERINFRASTRUCTURE, FOSTERS CROSS-INSTITUTIONAL COLLABORATION, AND ACCELERATES SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY THROUGH IMPROVED DATA HANDLING FROM COLLECTION TO PUBLICATION. THIS AWARD REFLECTS NSF'S STATUTORY MISSION AND HAS BEEN DEEMED WORTHY OF SUPPORT THROUGH EVALUATION USING THE FOUNDATION'S INTELLECTUAL MERIT AND BROADER IMPACTS REVIEW CRITERIA.- SUBAWARDS ARE NOT PLANNED FOR THIS AWARD.",
