    "Description": "GRAZING SHEEP OR OTHER ANIMALS TO CONVERT COVER CROPS TO MANURE INFIELD HAS A NUMBER OF PRACTICAL BENEFITS SUCH AS NEGATING LABOR AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MANURE TRANSPORT, REDUCING PESTS, AND INCREASING SOIL FERTILITY AND SOIL HEALTH. GIVEN THESE BENEFITS, THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED INTEREST IN THE USE OF COVER CROPS AND LIVESTOCK GRAZING IN NUT ORCHARDS (ALMONDS, WALNUTS AND PISTACHIOS). HOWEVER, GRAZING LIVESTOCK ARE NATURAL RESERVOIRS FOR FOODBORNE PATHOGENS, AND DIET TYPE CAN INCREASE FOODBORNE PATHOGEN SHEDDING IN MANURE AND AFFECT THEIR SURVIVAL IN THE SOIL. WHILE MANY GROWERS CONSIDER LIVESTOCK GRAZING OF COVER-CROPS ON ORCHARDS AS A WAY TO ENHANCE SOIL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS, RECENT CONCERNS ABOUT MICROBIAL FOOD SAFETY ARE LIMITING EXPANSION OF THIS PRACTICE BECAUSE LIVESTOCK GRAZING MAY INTRODUCE PATHOGENS INTO SOIL WITH A POTENTIAL FOR TRANSFER TO NUTS. THEREFORE, WE ARE PROPOSING A MULTI-REGIONAL INTEGRATED RESEARCH-EXTENSION APPROACH TO FULLY ASSESS THE BENEFITSOF LIVESTOCK INTEGRATION VIA COVER-CROP GRAZING ON BACTERIAL POPULATION DYNAMICS, SOIL HEALTH, PEST CONTROL AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF COVER CROPS WHILE LIMITING FOOD SAFETY RISKS IN ORGANIC ORCHARDS IN TWO DISTINCT AGROECOLOGICAL REGIONS IN CALIFORNIA. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO IMPROVE THE MICROBIAL FOOD SAFETY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF ORGANIC NUTS WHILE MAINTAINING THE VALUE OF INTEGRATION OF LIVESTOCK AND COVER CROPS IN NUT PRODUCTION WHILE LIMITING FOOD SAFETY RISKS AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS, AND PROMOTING SUSTAINABILITY AND BIODIVERSITY.",
