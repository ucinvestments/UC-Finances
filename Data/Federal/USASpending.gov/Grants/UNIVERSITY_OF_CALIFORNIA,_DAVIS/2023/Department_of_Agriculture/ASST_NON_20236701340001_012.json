    "Description": "SNAP BEANS, ALSO KNOWN AS GREEN BEANS, DIFFER FROM THEIR DRY BEAN RELATIVES IN SEVERAL CRITICAL POD QUALITY TRAITS, WHICH ARE GENETICALLY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY UNSTABLE. IN THIS PROJECT, WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE GENETIC BASIS OF THIS VARIATION AND TAKE THE FIRST STEPS TOWARDS REDUCING PRODUCTION COSTS AND PROMOTING THE STABILITY OF HIGH CULINARY QUALITY IN THIS IMPORTANT VEGETABLE CROP.COMMON BEAN (PHASEOLUS VULGARIS) IS PRODUCED FOR TWO MAJOR MARKET CATEGORIES IN THE UNITED STATES, 1) DRY BEANS GROWN FOR PROTEIN-RICH SEEDS, AND 2) SNAP OR GREEN BEANS GROWN FOR EDIBLE PODS AS VEGETABLES. THESE TWO CLASSES ARE DISTINGUISHED BY SEVERAL MAJOR DIFFERENCES RELATED TO POD STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE INCLUDE POD SHAPE (FLAT VS. ROUND), POD WALL FIBER (TOUGH VS. TENDER), AND POD SUTURE STRINGS (STRINGY VS. NON-STRINGY). COMMERCIAL SNAP BEANS MUST HAVE ROUND CROSS SECTIONS AND VERY LOW LEVELS OF POD FIBER TO BE COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTED.INTRIGUINGLY, THESE TRAITS SPONTANEOUSLYREVERT FROM THE SNAP BEAN STATE TO THE ANCESTRAL DRY BEAN FORM, AT A RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 1%. THIS REVERSION IS HERITABLE, AND THE SEEDS FROM THESE PLANTS WILL ALSO FORM THE UNDESIRABLE TRAITS. THIS REVERSION MAKES IT CRITICAL FOR EACH PLANT IN SEED PRODUCTION FIELDS TO BE INDIVIDUALLY CHECKED TO REMOVE (ROGUE) REVERTANTS, WHICH COSTS $50,000 PER VARIETY PER COMPANY PER YEARTO SEED PRODUCERS. BEYOND THIS, POD FIBER DEPOSITION IN MANY SNAP BEANS IS GREATLY EXACERBATED BY HEAT AND DROUGHT, BUT THE TS (TEMPERATURE SENSITIVE) GENEHAS NEVER BEEN MAPPED GENETICALLY. HARVESTED SNAP BEANS WITH HIGHFIBERARE SUBJECT TO MARKET REJECTION, MAKING THE IDENTIFICATION OF THIS GENETIC VARIATIONIMPORTANT IN THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CHANGE.HERE, WE PROPOSE TO EXPLORE THE GENETIC AND DEVELOPMENTAL BASIS OF EACH TRAIT AND ITS INSTABILITY BY CONDUCTING GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION STUDIES (GWAS), EXTENSIVE WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING AND DIVERSITY ANALYSES, FLUORESCENCE MICROSCOPY, AND RT-QPCR. THESE STUDIES WILL IN PART TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HIGHLY CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM OF REVERTANT / NON-REVERTANT PAIRS OF IDENTICAL GENETIC BACKGROUND. FINALLY, WE WILL USE OUR NEW GENETIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL GENETICS OF POD STABILITY TO SELECT GENETIC STOCKS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF STABILITY IN OTHERWISE UNSTABLE TYPES OF COMMERCIAL IMPORTANCE. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WILL REDUCE SEED PRODUCTION COSTS, IMPROVE PRODUCT QUALITY, PROMOTECLIMATE CHANGE RESILIENCE, AND GREATLY FACILITATE BREEDING IN A NUTRITIOUS AND BROADLY CONSUMED VEGETABLE CROP.",
