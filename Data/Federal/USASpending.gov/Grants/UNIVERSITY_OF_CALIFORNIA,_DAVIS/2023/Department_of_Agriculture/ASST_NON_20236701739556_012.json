    "Description": "AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) DESTROYS THE MACULA, THE PART OF THE RETINA THAT CONFERS SHARP, CLEAR AND COLOR VISION. THE DISEASE RISK INCREASES WITH AGE AND AFFECTS WOMEN MORE THAN MEN. NO OPTIONS YET EXIST TO REDUCE THE RISK OF EARLY AMD, BUT THE DIETARY CAROTENOIDS LUTEIN AND ZEAXANTHIN, WHICH ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE MACULA, SHOW PROMISE, SINCE THEY BLOCK DAMAGING BLUE LIGHT AND MODULATE OXIDATIVE STRESS. GOJI BERRIES CONTAIN THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF ZEAXANTHIN AMONG ALL KNOWN DIETARY SOURCES, AND ALONG WITH THE LUTEIN AND A DISTINCTIVE POLYSACCHARIDE, MAY OFFER AN APPROACH TO REDUCE THE RISK OF AMD. WE HAVE RECENTLY SHOWN THAT GOJI BERRY INTAKE FOR 90 DAYS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED A BIOMARKER OF LUTEIN AND ZEAXANTHIN IN THE MACULA IN HEALTHY ADULTS. HERE WE PROPOSE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF GOJI BERRY INTAKE FOR 180 DAYS AMONG PARTICIPANTS AT-RISK FOR AMD, AND COMPARE THEIR MULTIPLE OCULAR OUTCOMES TO A CONTROL GROUP CONSUMING CALORIE- AND FIBER-MATCHED GUMMIES OUR STUDY WILL ALSO PROFILE GUT MICROBIOME CHANGES USING SHALLOW SHOTGUN METAGENOMIC SEQUENCING, ASSESS DIFFERENCES IN ASSOCIATED PLASMA MICROBIAL METABOLITES, AND FOLLOW PLASMA LEVELS OF LUTEIN AND ZEAXANTHIN. THIS THREE-YEAR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL ADDRESSES THE AFRI PROGRAM AREA PRIORITY FOOD AND HUMAN HEALTH USING A WHOLE FOODS APPROACH. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE RESULTS CAN GIVE CONSUMERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS NEW FOOD-BASED OPTIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF AMD AND PROMOTE BETTER EYE HEALTH. THE RESULTS MAY ALSO STIMULATE DEVELOPMENT OF GOJI BERRIES AS A VIABLE SPECIALTY CROP IN THE UNITED STATES.",
