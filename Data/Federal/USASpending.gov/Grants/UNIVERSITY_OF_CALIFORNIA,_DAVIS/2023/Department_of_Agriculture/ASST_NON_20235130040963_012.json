    "Description": "ORGANIC FARMERS NEED TO HAVE ADAPTED CROP CULTIVARS TO BE OPTIMALLY PRODUCTIVE AND PROFITABLE. BREEDING CROPS UNDER ORGANIC MANAGEMENT WILL RESULT IN CULTIVARS WELL-SUITED TO PRODUCTION NEEDS OF THOSE SYSTEMS, SUCH AS IMPROVED DISEASE RESISTANCE OR NOVEL TRAITS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY RELEVANT FOR ORGANIC PRODUCTION. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROGRAM ARE TO BREED NEW VARIETIES OF TOMATO, WHEAT, ZINNIA, COMMON BEAN, CELTUCE, AND SPINACH FOR ORGANIC PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA AND NEIGHBORING STATES. THIS PROJECT BUILDS ON OUR EXISTING OREI-FUNDED BREEDING PIPELINES THAT ARE LED BY STUDENTS WHO GAIN EXPERIENTIAL TRAINING IN FIELD-BASED PLANT BREEDING DIRECTLY IN ORGANIC SYSTEMS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE ADD NEW CROPS AND EXPAND OUR PROGRAM TO UC SANTA CRUZ, WHO WILL BE FOCUSING ON BREEDING FOR DRY FARMING. WITH BOTH SELF- AND CROSS-FERTILIZED CROPS AND VEGETABLE, AGRONOMIC, AND ORNAMENTAL SPECIES, STUDENTS WILL GAIN FAMILIARITY WITH A BROAD COMPLEMENT OF BREEDING SYSTEMS AND VARIETY TYPES, INCLUDING PURE LINE, OPEN-POLLINATED, AND HYBRID CULTIVARS AND DEVELOP NEW CULTIVARS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DIVERSE ORGANIC GROWERS. WE WILL DEVELOP INSTRUCTIONAL INFORMATION TO HELP NEW STUDENTS AND FARMERS UNDERSTAND AND UNDERTAKE BREEDING, SELECTION, AND EVALUATION TRIALS. THE ORGANIC SEED ALLIANCE WILL ORGANIZE REGULAR INTERACTIONS AND MEETINGS BETWEEN STUDENT RESEARCHERS, FACULTY, ORGANIC SEED COMPANIES, AND ORGANIC GROWERS. WE WILL DEVELOP AND CONDUCT ON-FARM TRIALS, HOST EXTENSION EVENTS AT TRIAL SITES, AND ENSURE THAT NEW, PUBLICLY RELEASED CULTIVARS DERIVED FROM OUR PROGRAM WILL BE USEFUL AND AVAILABLE TO ORGANIC GROWERS AND ORGANIC SEED COMPANIES.",
