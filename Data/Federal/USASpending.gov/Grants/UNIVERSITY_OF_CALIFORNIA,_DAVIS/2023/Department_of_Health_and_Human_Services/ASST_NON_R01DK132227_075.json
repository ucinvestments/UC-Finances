    "Description": "DECIPHER THE FUNCTION OF C2CD4A IN METABOLISM - PROJECT SUMMARY TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2D) IS CAUSED BY INSULIN RESISTANCE IN PERIPHERAL TISSUES AND PANCREATIC BETA-CELL DYSFUNCTION. INSULIN RESISTANCE PRECEDES BETA-CELL FAILURE, AND THE BETA-CELL’S INABILITY TO KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASED DEMAND OF INSULIN PRODUCTION AND SECRETION LEADS TO GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE AND HYPERGLYCEMIA. THE HUMAN C2CD4B-C2CD4A-VPS13C LOCUS HARBORS A PANCREATIC BETA-CELL SUPER-ENHANCER, AND IS HEAVILY DECORATED BY T2D RISK-ASSOCIATED GWAS SNPS FROM VIRTUALLY EVERY ETHNIC GROUP STUDIED TO DATE. THERE ARE ONLY ~20 PUBLICATIONS ON “C2CD4A” IN PUBMED, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE ASSOCIATION STUDIES LINKING THIS LOCUS TO HUMAN DIABETES SUSCEPTIBILITY. THROUGH A MULTI-OMICS APPROACH FOLLOWED BY FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS IN MICE, WE FOUND THAT BETA CELL-SPECIFIC C2CD4A ABLATION IMPAIRS INSULIN SECRETION. IN THIS PROPOSAL, THROUGH C2CD4A WE PROVIDE A BASIS TO LINK EXERCISE-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA AND TYPE 2 DIABETES TREATMENT. WE WILL INVESTIGATE C2CD4A-REGULATED BETA CELL FUNCTION, AND BUILD A PATHWAY CENTERED ON C2CD4A. TWO AIMS ARE ENVISIONED: IN AIM 1, WE WILL MAP THE REPRESSOR DOMAIN USING TRUNCATED VERSIONS OF HUMAN AND MOUSE C2CD4A, AND INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISM OF EXERCISE-INDUCED HYPOGLYCEMIA IN BETA CELL-SPECIFIC C2CD4A KNOCKOUT MICE. IN AIM 2, WE WILL SOLIDIFY C2CD4A’S ROLE IN THE NUCLEUS AS A TRANSCRIPTION COFACTOR, ACTING ON PROMOTERS AND ENHANCERS OF KEY BETA CELL GENES. WE WILL EXAMINE THE REGULATION OF C2CD4A BY A NOVEL INTERGENIC LONG NONCODING RNA. THESE AIMS WILL ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF C2CD4A AS A HUMAN DIABETES SUSCEPTIBILITY GENE, AND PROVIDE A BLUEPRINT TO LEVERAGE HUMAN GENETICS DATA INTO BIOLOGICAL INSIGHT THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BENEFIT PATIENTS.",
