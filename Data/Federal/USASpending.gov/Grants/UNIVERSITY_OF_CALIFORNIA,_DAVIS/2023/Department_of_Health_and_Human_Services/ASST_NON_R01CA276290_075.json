UNDERSTANDING THE FUNCTIONS OF KEY PROTEINS IN HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION, MANY OF WHICH ARE TUMOR SUPPRESSORS, WILL PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HOW MUTATIONS IN THESE PROTEINS CAN PREDISPOSE INDIVIDUALS TO CANCER. WE PLAN TO ELUCIDATE THE BIOCHEMICAL ROLES AND EXAMINE THE MECHANISM OF BRCA1, BLM, EXO1, PALB2, WRN, AND THE RAD51 PARALOGS (RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2, AND XRCC3) FUNCTIONS, AS WELL AS THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THESE PROTEINS, TO PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THEIR ROLE IN RECOMBINATIONAL DNA REPAIR. WE PLAN TO RECONSTITUTE THE INITIAL STEPS OF HUMAN RECOMBINATIONAL DNA REPAIR, FOCUSING ON THE DNA RESECTION STEP, AND THEREBY UNDERSTAND THE BIOCHEMICAL FUNCTIONS OF THESE PROTEINS. IN ADDITION, WE WILL USE SINGLE-MOLECULE TECHNOLOGIES TO REVEAL THE MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE PROTEINS ACT.",
