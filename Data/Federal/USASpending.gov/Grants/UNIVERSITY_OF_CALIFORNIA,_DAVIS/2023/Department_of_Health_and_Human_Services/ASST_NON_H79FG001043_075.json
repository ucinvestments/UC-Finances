REARREST IS SO COMMON THAT IT IS KNOWN AS A \"REVOLVING DOOR\" THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY COSTS. DESPITE THE AVAILABILITY OF MULTIPLE COMMUNITY SERVICES TO ADDRESS NEEDS, BARRIERS EXIST INCLUDING: (1) KNOWING WHICH SERVICES ACCEPT INDIVIDUALS WITH SUBSTANCE USE OR SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS, (2) LACK OF VALID IDENTIFICATION OR A PERMANENT ADDRESS, OR (3) EXECUTIVE DYSFUNCTION ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND OTHER MENTAL ILLNESSES. UC DAVIS PSYCHIATRY COLLABORATES WITH THE LARGEST FEDERALLY-QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER IN SACRAMENTO, WELLSPACE HEALTH, TO CONDUCT A UNIQUE CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR RECENTLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS READY TO ENGAGE DUBBED THE SAFE-T (SUB-ACUTE FACILITATED ENGAGEMENT AND TRANSITIONS) PROGRAM. WITH THE PROPOSED FUNDING, WE WILL LINK INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT YET READY TO ENGAGE WITH THE DIGITAL DAVIS SAFE-T MODULE, DEVELOPED FOR THIS PROJECT. THIS MODULE WILL PROVIDE A DIGITIZED VERSION OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT CAN BE SHARED AND ACCESSED VIA OMNI-CHANNEL MESSAGING (E.G., TEXT MESSAGE, CHATBOT, ETC.). IN ADDITION, IT WILL REASSESS READINESS TO ENGAGE BY FOLLOW-UP MESSAGE TWO DAYS, FIVE DAYS, ONE WEEK AND TWO WEEKS AFTER RELEASE. IF READINESS HAS CHANGED IN A POSITIVE WAY, INDIVIDUALS WILL BE LINKED WITH OUR SAFE-T CASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE DIGITAL DAVIS SAFE-T MODULE WILL DIGITIZE DATA COLLECTION, MAINTAIN A CONNECTION WITH INDIVIDUALS, ASSESS THEIR PROGRESS, AND TRACK RESOURCE ACCESS AND UTILIZATION. ALL INDIVIDUALS IN THE SAFE-T PROGRAM WILL BE ABLE TO ACCESS CRISIS MANAGEMENT THROUGH CRISIS RECEIVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.",
