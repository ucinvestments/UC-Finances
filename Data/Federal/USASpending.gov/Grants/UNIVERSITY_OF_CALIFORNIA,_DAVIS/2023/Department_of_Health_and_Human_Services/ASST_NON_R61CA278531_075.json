    "Description": "MICROFLUIDIC TECHNOLOGY TO ISOLATE TUMORICIDAL T-CELLS FROM PERIPHERAL BLOOD - PROJECT SUMMARY ADOPTIVE CELL TRANSFER (ACT) USING EX VIVO EXPANDED ANTI-TUMOR T-CELLS HAS GARNERED SIGNIFICANT INTEREST DUE TO SUCCESSES IN TREATING MELANOMA AND OTHER CANCERS. THIS IS A HIGHLY PERSONALIZED THERAPY, IN WHICH AUTOLOGOUS T-CELLS THAT CAN TARGET THE TUMORS ARE REQUIRED. HOWEVER, FINDING CELLS THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET TUMORS REMAINS A MAJOR HURDLE FOR THE WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF T-CELL BASED ACT THERAPIES. THE CURRENT METHODS OF LYMPHOCYTE ENRICHMENT RESULT IN MODEST INCREASES IN TUMORICIDAL T-CELLS WITH LITTLE CONTROL OVER THE CLONAL HETEROGENEITY. A TECHNOLOGY THAT OVERCOMES THESE CHALLENGES WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE BARRIERS (E.G., REDUCE COST, REDUCE OFF-TARGET EFFECTS) FOR BROAD DISSEMINATION OF ACT THERAPIES. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO DEVELOP A SEPARATION TECHNOLOGY TO ENRICH A POPULATION OF LYMPHOCYTES WITH TUMORICIDAL T-CELLS BASED ON THEIR CAPACITY TO RECOGNIZE AUTOLOGOUS TUMOR ANTIGENS. THE PREMISE OF OUR MICROFLUIDIC TECHNOLOGY IS THAT TUMORICIDAL T-CELLS CAN BE SEPARATED FROM A BULK LEUKOCYTE POPULATION WHEN EXPOSED TO TUMOR-DERIVED PEPTIDE-MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX I UNDER OPTIMAL FLOW CONDITIONS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE TO: 1) DEVELOP A MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE TO ENRICH A POPULATION OF LYMPHOCYTES WITH ANTIGEN SPECIFIC T-CELLS, AND 2) DEMONSTRATE THE CAPACITY OF THE MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM TO ENRICH PATIENT-DERIVED PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS WITH TUMORICIDAL T-CELLS USING PATIENT- MATCHED TUMOR CELLS. ACCOMPLISHING OUR PRIMARY GOAL WILL CREATE A POTENTIALLY DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD PAVE WAY FOR WIDE-SPREAD APPLICATION OF T-CELL BASED ACT THERAPIES, AND THE AGNOSTIC FEATURE (I.E., NO A PRIORI KNOWLEDGE OF TUMOR ANTIGEN(S) IS REQUIRED) OF THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD MAKE IT BROADLY APPLICABLE FOR A PERSONALIZED MEDICINE APPROACH TO A RANGE OF CANCERS.",
