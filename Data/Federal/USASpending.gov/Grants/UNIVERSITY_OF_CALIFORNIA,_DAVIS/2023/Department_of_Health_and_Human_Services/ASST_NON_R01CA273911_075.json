    "Description": "REGULATION OF DNA DOUBLE-STRAND BREAK REPAIR PATHWAY CHOICE - PROJECT SUMMARY THE GENERAL GOAL OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH IS TO DEFINE THE MECHANISTIC UNDERPINNING FOR THE SYNTHETIC LETHALITY NETWORK BETWEEN A DEFICIENCY IN HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION (HR) AND DEFECTS IN SINGLE-STRAND ANNEALING (RAD52) OR POLQ-MEDIATED END-JOINING (TMEJ). EXCITING PRELIMINARY DATA REVEALED THAT BRCA2 AND RAD52 DELAY THE REPAIR OF S-PHASE-ASSOCIATED DNA DOUBLE-STRANDED BREAKS (DSB) BY TMEJ UNTIL M-PHASE. THIS REGULATION AVOIDS TMEJ-MEDIATED CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENTS OF ONE-SIDED DSBS THAT ARE PRODUCED BY REPLICATION FORK BREAKAGE. OUR APPROACH COMBINES INNOVATIVE CELL CYCLE PHASE RESOLVED IMAGING OF DNA REPAIR PROTEINS AND DNA DAMAGE MARKERS WITH MECHANISTIC BIOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS USING PURIFIED HUMAN PROTEINS IN RECONSTITUTED REACTIONS. OUR RESULTS WILL HAVE POTENTIAL TRANSLATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF NEWLY DEVELOPED RAD52 AND POLQ INHIBITORS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HR-DEFICIENT TUMORS WITH RESPECT TO APPLICATION PROTOCOLS, PATIENT SELECTION, AND USE OF DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE CHECKPOINT INHIBITORS AS WELL AS THE RESPONSE TO POLY(ADP-RIBOSE) POLYMERASE INHIBITION. THE SPECIFIC AIMS ARE: 1. DEFINE THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF BRCA2 IN DSB REPAIR PATHWAY CONTROL. WE WILL TEST THE MODEL THAT THE  DNA BINDING PROPERTIES OF BRCA2 ARE CRITICAL FOR TMEJ INHIBITION. IN AIM 1A, WE CONDUCT FOUNDATIONAL STUDIES  TO DETERMINE THE FUNDAMENTAL DNA BINDING PROPERTIES OF FULL-LENGTH BRCA2. IN AIM 1B, WE WILL DEFINE WHICH  DOMAINS OF BRCA2 ARE REQUIRED FOR TMEJ INHIBITION IN CELLS. THIS COMBINATION OF CELL-BASED AND BIOCHEMICAL  STUDIES WILL DEFINE THE FUNCTIONS AND REGIONS OF BRCA2 THAT ARE REQUIRED FOR TMEJ INHIBITION. 2. DEFINE THE MECHANISM OF TMEJ INHIBITION BY BRCA2 AND RAD52. BRCA2 AND RAD52 EMPLOY TWO DIFFERENT  MODES TO INHIBIT THE DNA POLYMERASE ACTIVITY OF POLQ WHICH MAY AFFECT ADDITIONAL REACTION STEPS IN THE TMEJ  PROCESS. WE WILL RECONSTITUTE TMEJ IN VITRO WITH PURIFIED PROTEINS TO DETERMINE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH  BRCA2 (AIM 2A) AND RAD52 (AIM 2B) INHIBIT TMEJ. WE WILL TEST INHIBITION OF THE OVERALL TMEJ REACTION AND  INDIVIDUAL STEPS INCLUDING 1) DNA BINDING, 2) END-ALIGNMENT, AND 3) DNA SYNTHESIS. ANALYSIS OF WILD TYPE AND  CATALYTIC MUTANTS OF POLQ WILL BE CONDUCTED IN VITRO AND IN CELLS. 3. DEFINE WHICH HR DEFECTS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO RAD52 LOSS OF FUNCTION. IT IS AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER LOSS  OF RAD52 WILL LEAD TO POLQ-MEDIATED CHROMOSOME FUSIONS AND LETHALITY IN ALL HR-DEFICIENT BACKGROUNDS (AIM  3A) OR ALL BRCA2 MUTANTS (AIM 3B). OUR PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST A MODEL THAT LOADING OF BRCA2 IS THE  CRITICAL STEP TO LIMIT TMEJ TO M-PHASE AND THAT HR DEFECTS PAST THIS STEP ARE NOT AFFECTED BY RAD52 INHIBITION.",
