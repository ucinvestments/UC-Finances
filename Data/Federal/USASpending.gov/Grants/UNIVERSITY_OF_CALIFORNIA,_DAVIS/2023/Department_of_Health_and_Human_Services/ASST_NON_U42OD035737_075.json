THE NONHUMAN PRIMATE TESTING CENTER BRINGS TOGETHER A ROBUST TEAM OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATORS WITH PARTNERSHIPS THAT CAPITALIZE ON MAJOR STRENGTHS AT UC DAVIS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA NATIONAL PRIMATE RESEARCH CENTER, GENOME CENTER, AND CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE CENTER. THE PROGRAM WILL PROVIDE UNIQUE STATE-OF-THE-ART CAPABILITIES FOR INVESTIGATORS TO CONDUCT HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES. THE NONHUMAN PRIMATE TESTING CENTER LEVERAGES A SUPPORTIVE FRAMEWORK THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO OUTREACH AND PROVIDING COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INVESTIGATORS NATIONWIDE TO ADVANCE THEIR TRANSLATIONAL PRECLINICAL RESEARCH GOALS, INCLUDING PROGRESSION TO HUMAN CLINICAL TRIALS. THROUGH THIS POWERFUL AND PROVEN INFRASTRUCTURE, THE CENTER FOR SOMATIC CELL GENOME EDITING IN NONHUMAN PRIMATES WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) PROVIDE AN ADMINISTRATIVE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE TO ADVANCE SOMATIC CELL GENOME EDITING STUDIES TARGETING A RANGE OF HUMAN DISEASES IN ALL AGE GROUPS, (2) PARTNER WITH INVESTIGATORS TO ACCELERATE THEIR TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH OBJECTIVES, AND (3) ENSURE SYNERGISM AND SHARING ACROSS THE SMALL AND LARGE ANIMAL TESTING CENTERS AND TRANSPARENT INTERACTIONS WITH THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY AND THE NIH. OUR ROBUST MULTIDISCIPLINARY TEAM IS POISED TO CONTINUE OUR NATIONAL ROLE AND SERVICE TO THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY BY BRINGING THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT INVESTIGATORS, AND SAFELY ADVANCE SOMATIC CELL GENOME EDITING TECHNOLOGIES TO NEW TREATMENTS FOR HUMAN DISEASES.",
