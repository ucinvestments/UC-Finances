    "Description": "ASSESSING FUNCTIONAL IMMUNITY TO INFLUENZA INFECTION BY QUANTIFYING BCR BINDING AVIDITIES - PROJECT SUMMARY ACTIVATION, CLONAL EXPANSION, AND AFFINITY MATURATION OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC B CELLS ARE CONSIDERED THE HALLMARKS OF ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; HENCE, THE ASSESSMENT OF B CELL RESPONSES IS THOUGHT TO PROVIDE CORRELATES OF IMMUNE PROTECTION. ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC B CELL RESPONSES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN OBSERVED INDIRECTLY, BY EXAMINING THE SERUM ANTIBODY POOL USING ELISA, OR IN THE CASE OF INFLUENZA THE HEMAGGLUTININ INHIBITION ASSAY (HIA). DIRECT MEASUREMENTS OF ANTIBODY-SECRETING CELLS HAVE ALSO BEEN DONE USING ELISPOT, OR MORE RECENTLY BY FLOW CYTOMETRY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO TOOLS TO ASSESS THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE NON-ANTIBODY (AB) SECRETING MEMORY B CELL (BMEM) POOL. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT LIMITATION AS BMEM, MORE THAN THE CIRCULATING AB POOL, CONTAIN CROSS-REACTIVE AND CROSS-PROTECTIVE CELLS THAT COULD RESPOND TO A CHALLENGE INFECTION WITH A MUTATED PATHOGEN VARIANT, SUCH AS OCCURS DURING THE SEASONAL YEARLY INFLUENZA SURGES. KNOWING THE EXTENT TO WHICH BMEM CELLS EXIST AND CAN BIND TO THE ORIGINAL OR EMERGING VARIANTS OF A PATHOGEN WOULD GREATLY HELP, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH DECISIONS ABOUT WHEN TO UPDATE VACCINES TO THE CIRCULATING SEASONAL INFLUENZA OR SARS-COV-2 STRAINS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO GENERATE SUCH A TOOL. OUR RECENT WORK DEMONSTRATES THE PROOF-OF- CONCEPT THAT A SIMPLE MICROFLUIDIC PLATFORM CAN CAPTURE THE FULL AVIDITY SPECTRUM OF ANTIGEN-SPECIFIC B CELLS, AND THAT THE EQUILIBRIUM BINDING AVIDITY OF THE BCR CORRELATES STRONGLY WITH THE BINDING AFFINITY OF THE SECRETED ANTIBODY. WE HAVE DUBBED THIS APPROACH AND TECHNOLOGY THE SHEAR-FORCE AVIDITY-BASED CELL SELECTOR (SACS). THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION OF OUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS: CAPTURE, SEPARATION, AND QUANTIFICATION OF PERIPHERAL B CELLS BASED ON THE FORCE-DEPENDENT BCR BINDING AVIDITY CAN BE USED AS A MEASURE OF FUNCTIONAL IMMUNE STATUS. TO TEST OUR HYPOTHESIS, AND FULLY DEVELOP THE SACS TECHNOLOGY, THE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THIS PROJECT ARE TO: 1) ENHANCE THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZE A MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE WITH THE CAPACITY TO CAPTURE AND SEPARATE A COMPLEX POOL OF B CELLS BASED ON BCR BINDING AVIDITY TO A DEFINED ANTIGEN; AND 2) CHARACTERIZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BINDING AVIDITY DYNAMICS OF INFLUENZA-SPECIFIC PERIPHERAL B CELLS AND IMMUNE STATUS FOLLOWING INFLUENZA VIRUS INFECTION. OUR PLATFORM WILL DEMONSTRATE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A RAPID AND EASILY ADAPTABLE SYSTEM TO EVALUATE THE DYNAMICS OF THE B CELL RESPONSE TO INFLUENZA, BUT IS COMPLETELY ADAPTABLE TO HOST OF OTHER PATHOGENS SUCH AS SARS-COV-2. EXPECTED RESULTS WOULD PROVIDE A NEW MEASUREMENT PLATFORM (SACS) THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME THE RAPID ASSESSMENT OF THE RANGE OF FUNCTIONAL BCR-ANTIGEN INTERACTION STRENGTHS OF INDIVIDUAL B CELLS WITHIN THE COMPLEX POOLS OF PERIPHERAL B CELLS AND B CELL SUBSETS TO PREDICT FUNCTIONAL IMMUNITY.",
