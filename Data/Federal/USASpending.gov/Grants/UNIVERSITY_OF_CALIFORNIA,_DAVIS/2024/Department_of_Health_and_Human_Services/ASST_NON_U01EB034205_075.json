    "Description": "PHANTOM AND AUTOMATED ANALYSIS FOR ADVANCED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SYSTEMS - MULTIPLE-X-RAY SOURCE ARRAY-BASED COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (MXA-CT) THE LONG-TERM OBJECTIVES OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH ARE TO DEVELOP AN X-RAY TUBE WHICH CONTAINS AN ARRAY OF 6 X- RAY SOURCES WITHIN THE SAME VACUUM ENCLOSURE, AND THEN DEMONSTRATE THE UTILITY OF THIS MULTIPLE X -RAY SOURCE ARRAY (MXA) TOWARDS IMPROVING IMAGE QUALITY IN WHOLE BODY (GENERAL-PURPOSE) COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCANNERS AS WELL AS CONE BEAM CT SYSTEMS. CURRENT CT SYSTEMS WITH A SINGLE X-RAY SOURCE WHICH HAVE LARGE COVERAGE ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE PATIENT (THE Z-AXIS) SUFFER FROM CONSIDERABLE CONE BEAM ARTIFACTS AT THE PERIPHERAL EDGES OF THE FIELD-OF-VIEW, DUE TO INCOMPLETE SAMPLING CAUSED BY ANGLED X-RAY TRAJECTORIES IMPOSED BY THE GEOMETRY OF A SINGLE X-RAY SOURCE SYSTEM. BY ALIGNING SIX X-RAY SOURCES ALONG THE Z-AXIS AND PULSING THEM WISELY DURING THE CT SCAN, THE ANGLED X-RAY TRAJECTORIES WHICH CAUSE CONE BEAM ARTIFACTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED, ESSENTIALLY ELIMINATING THESE CONE BEAM ARTIFACTS. THE SPECIFIC AIMS INCLUDE (1) DESIGN, FABRICATION AND TESTING OF THE SIX-SOURCE X-RAY TUBE, (2) DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A TEST BED TABLETOP CT SCANNER WHICH WILL USE THE MXA SOURCE TO DEMONSTRATE THE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED SCANNER SYSTEM AS A PROOF -OF- PRINCIPLE, (3) WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST MANUFACTURERS OF X-RAY TUBES IN THE WORLD (VAREX) TO GAIN FROM THEIR X-RAY TUBE (AND DETECTOR) EXPERIENCE AND DEMONSTRATE WITH THEM THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL POTENTIAL OF THIS NEW X-RAY TUBE DESIGN IN A WAY THAT FACILITATES COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE MXA-CT TECHNOLOGY, (4) DEVELOPMENT OF CT IMAGE RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS (INCLUDING CONVENTIONAL AND AI-BASED) WHICH ARE SPECIFICALLY TAILORED TO THE UNIQUE GEOMETRY OF THE PROPOSED TABLETOP CT PROTOTYPE, (5) PERFORM MONTE CARLO AND OTHER COMPUTER SIMULATIONS TO THOROUGHLY EVALUATE THE RADIATION DOSE DISTRIBUTION PRODUCED BY THIS NEW SCA NNER GEOMETRY, AND (6) USE PHANTOM AND CADAVER IMAGING EXPERIMENTS ON THE PROTOTYPE MXA-CT SYSTEM TO DEMONSTRATE SUPERIOR CT IMAGING PERFORMANCE USING RIGOROUS QUANTITATIVE METRICS OF IMAGE QUALITY AND ARTIFACT REDUCTION. THIS PROPOSAL IS SUBMITTED UNDER THE BIOENGINEERING PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY (BPI, PAR-22-123), AND REPRESENTS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS, JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO ALBUQUERQUE, AND VAREX IMAGING AS OUR CORPORATE PARTNER.
