    "Description": "THIS PROJECT IS TO CONTINUE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOOD ANIMAL RESIDUE AVOIDANCE DATABANK (FARAD), A COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM FUNDED SINCE 1982 BY USDA. FARAD HAS FIVE REGIONAL CENTERS; NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY, KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY- OLATHE, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA, VIRGINIA TECH UNIVERSITY AND UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, DAVIS. THE GOAL IS TO PRODUCE SAFE FOOD FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION BY PREVENTING VIOLATIVE CHEMICAL RESIDUES IN FOOD ANIMAL PRODUCTS. VETERINARIANS, REGULATORY AGENCIES, EXTENSION SPECIALISTS, AND STATE VETERINARIANS USE FARAD, BUT THE ULTIMATE CLIENT IS THE PUBLIC WHO SHOULD BE ABLE TO CONSUME FOOD PRODUCTS THAT ARE FREE OF DRUG, CHEMICAL, AND PESTICIDE RESIDUES. FARAD ORIGINATED WITH THE RESIDUE AVOIDANCE PROGRAM (RAP) IN 1982 AS A REPOSITORY OF RESIDUE AVOIDANCE INFORMATION. OVER TIME, FARAD HAS EVOLVED INTO AN EXPERT-MEDIATED RESIDUE AVOIDANCE DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TIMELY ADVICE ON A WIDE RANGE OF DRUG AND CHEMICAL ENTITIES. THIS ABILITY TO PROVIDE VETERINARIANS WITH ADVICE REGARDING EXTRA-LABEL DRUG USE HAS PROVEN VITAL TO THE EXECUTION OF THE ANIMAL MEDICINAL DRUG USE CLARIFICATION ACT OF 1994 (AMDUCA) REGULATIONS THAT LEGALIZED THE EXTRA-LABEL USE OF DRUG IN FOOD ANIMALS BY VETERINARIANS. AMDUCA REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT EXTRA-LABEL USE OF DRUGS IN FOOD ANIMALS BE BASED ON SOUND SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES OF RESIDUE AVOIDANCE. MORE RECENTLY, FARAD HAS PROVIDED EXPERT ADVICE REGARDING VETERINARY FEED DIRECTIVES (VFD) AND CALIFORNIA SENATE BILL 27, ADDRESSING JUDICIOUS USE OF MEDICALLY IMPORTANT ANTIBIOTICS FOR HUMANS. OVERALL, FARAD CONTINUES TO SERVE A WIDE GROUP OF CONSTITUENTS AND HELPS TO ENSURE RESIDUE FREE FOOD PRODUCTS FOLLOWING EXTRA-LABEL DRUG USE BY FILLING GAPS THAT OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES (FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL PESTICIDE AGENCY) CAN\u0026#39;T ADDRESS.",
