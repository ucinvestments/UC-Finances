    "Description": "THIS PROJECT SUPPORTS THE MISSION OF THE AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION BY ADDRESSING THE HATCH ACT AREAS(S) OF PROCESSING, DISTRIBUTION, SAFETY, MARKETING, AND UTILIZATION OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PROJECT WILL FOCUS ON THE PRESSING ISSUE THAT HEALTHY, FERMENTED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES ARE DIFFICULT TO MAKE AT INDUSTRIAL SCALES AND ARE FREQUENTLY SUBJECT TO QUALITY DEFECTS AND INCONSISTENT PRODUCTS WITH VARIABLE SENSORY PROFILES. SPECIFICALLY, THE PROJECT WILL ASSESS THE USE OF ELECTROCHEMICALLY DRIVEN METHODS AND SELECTED SAFE MICROORGANISMS TO IMPROVE THE CONTROL OVER FRUIT AND VEGETABLE FERMENTATIONS. WE EXPECT THAT THE RESULTS FROM THIS PROJECT WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO AN EXPANSION IN LOW-COST, COMMERCIALLY-PRODUCED FERMENTED FRUIT AND VEGETABLE FOODS WITH OPTIMIZED SENSORY AND NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS. INCREASED AVAILABILITY OF THESE FOODS WILL IMPROVE CONSUMER ACCESS TO FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, THEREBY LEAD TO INCREASING DAILY INTAKES ACROSS THE US POPULATION. THE PROJECT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES THE NEED FOR US MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES TO ENSURE A MORE SUSTAINABLE, RESILIENT, AND HEALTHY FOOD SUPPLY. BROADLY, WE AIM TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGIES THAT INCREASE IMPROVE FOOD QUALITY AND NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND THAT ADVANCE SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO YIELD IMPROVED SHELF LIFE WHILE MINIMIZING FOOD WASTE AND LOSS THROUGHOUT THE FOOD SUPPLY CHAIN. THE PROJECT ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO ON-GOING EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ALL AMERICANS WITH SAFE, NUTRITIOUS FOOD.",
