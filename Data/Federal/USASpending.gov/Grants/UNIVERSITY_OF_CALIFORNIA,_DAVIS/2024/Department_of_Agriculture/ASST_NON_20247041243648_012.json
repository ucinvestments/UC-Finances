THIS IMPACT IS PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED IN LONG SHELF-LIFE CULTIVARS DUE TO NEGATIVE GENETIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SUGAR ACCUMULATION AND RIPENING-ASSOCIATED FRUIT SOFTENING IN NON-CLIMACTERIC FRUITS, SUCH AS STRAWBERRIES. THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE ENTIRE STRAWBERRY SUPPLY CHAIN CAN BE IMPROVED BY DEVELOPING, TESTING, RELEASING, AND PRODUCING STRAWBERRY CULTIVARS WITH DESIRABLE FRUIT QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS SUGAR ACCUMULATION, THE RATIO OF SUGAR AND ACID, THE AROMA PROFILE, SHELF LIFE AND FIELD HOLDING CAPACITY, AND ANTIOXIDANT AND VITAMIN C CONCENTRATION. VALUABLE ALLELES FOR A NOVEL, PREMIUM AROMA, AND OTHER DESIRABLE TRAITS ARE PRESENT IN HEIRLOOM VARIETIES AND WILD RELATIVES THAT CAN BE LEVERAGED THROUGH MODERN, DATA-DRIVEN BREEDING APPROACHES INFORMED BY GENETIC RELATIONSHIPS AND MOLECULAR DIVERSITY.THROUGH THE RESEARCH OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSAL, WE AIM TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FRUIT QUALITY GENETICS AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIFFERENT FRUIT QUALITY METRICS AND CONSUMER PREFERENCE AND WILLINGNESS TO BUY.",
