    "Description": "THIS INTEGRATED PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP NOVEL BIO-BASED APPROACHES TO CONTROL ROOT-KNOT NEMATODES AND PROMOTE THE TRANSLATION OF THESE APPROACHES TO AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES THROUGH EXTENSION AND OUTREACH TO STAKEHOLDERS. THE CURRENT METHODS USED FOR CONTROLLING THESE PESTS ARE UNSUSTAINABLE AND IMPACT WORKERS\u0026#39; HEALTH. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN TRANSLATING SUSTAINABLE BIOCHEMICAL PESTICIDES TO AGRICULTURE PRACTICES, AS LESS THAN 1 PERCENT OF THESE PESTICIDES ARE CURRENTLY USED IN ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE. THE PROPOSED APPROACHES ARE INSPIRED BY OUR RECENT DISCOVERIES THAT THE NEMATICIDAL ACTIVITY OF PLANT-DERIVED BIOCHEMICAL EXTRACTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED UPON ENCAPSULATION IN BIO-BASED CARRIERS WHILE THE PHYTOTOXICITY IS REDUCED. THUS ADDRESSING TWO SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO TRANSLATING BIOCHEMICAL EXTRACTS TO AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES. BASED ON THESE NEEDS AND INSPIRATION, THE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE: (A) DEVELOP BIO-BASED CARRIERS FOR ENCAPSULATING DIVERSE CLASS OF PLANT-DERIVED BIOCHEMICAL EXTRACTS WITH POTENTIAL NEMATICIDAL AND ATTRACTANT PROPERTIES FOR ROOT-KNOT NEMATODES AND EVALUATE THEIR EFFICACY IN MODEL SYSTEMS; (B) ASSESS THE ABILITY OF THESE BIO-BASED COMPOSITIONS TO ENHANCE NEMATICIDAL ACTIVITY WHILE REDUCING PHYTOTOXICITY IN SOIL/PLANT MICROCOSMS AND EVALUATE THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION; (C) EVALUATE THE TRANSLATION OF THESE OPTIMIZED FORMULATIONS TO CONTROL ROOT-KNOT NEMATODES AND DEVELOP A TECHNO-ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND (D) DEVELOP AN EXTENSION AND EDUCATION PROGRAM TO ENGAGE GROWERS AND FARM WORKERS TO FACILITATE TRANSLATION OF THESE BIO-BASED SOLUTIONS. SUCCESS IN THIS PROJECT WILL PROMOTE THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSLATION OF BIO-BASED APPROACHES FOR SUSTAINABLE BIO-ECONOMY.",
