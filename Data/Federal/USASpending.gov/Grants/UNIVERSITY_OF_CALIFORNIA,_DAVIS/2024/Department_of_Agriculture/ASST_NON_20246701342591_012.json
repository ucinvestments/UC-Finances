FAVORABLE ALLELES FOR DISEASE RESISTANCES AND BOTHER TRAITS MAY EXIST IN WILD RELATIVES AND ARE BECOMING MORE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH MODERN, DATA-DRIVEN BREEDING APPROACHES INFORMED BY KNOWLEDGE OF GENETIC RELATIONSHIPS AND MOLECULAR DIVERSITY. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE ALIGNED WITH THE FARM BILL PRIORITY OF PLANT HEALTH AND PRODUCTION AND PLANT PRODUCTS UNDER THE PROGRAM AREA OF PLANT BREEDING FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSES BREEDING FOR IMPROVED CROP PRODUCTIVITY, EFFICIENCY, QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, AND LOCAL ADAPTATION TO BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC STRESS. THROUGH THE RESEARCH OUTLINED IN THIS PROPOSAL WE WILL EXPAND OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GENETIC RESISTANCE TO MULTIPLE FRUIT ROT PATHOGENS AND DEVELOP TOOLS TO IDENTIFY AND SELECT FOR QTL THAT UNDERLIE DESIRABLE VARIATION. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WILL ADDRESS 1) THE ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF DONORS OF GENETIC RESISTANCE THAT EXIST IN PUBLIC GERMPLASM COLLECTIONS (USDA NCGR GRIN); 2) THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FRUIT QUALITY TRAITS THAT AFFECT CONSUMER PREFERENCE AND THE PROCLIVITY TO BE INFECTED; 3) THE DEVELOPMENT OF BREEDING STRATEGIES THAT SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVEMENT OF FRUIT ROT DISEASE RESISTANCE THAT DO NOT ELIMINATE CONSUMER-FOCUSED FRUIT QUALITY; AND 4) THE NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF COST-EFFECTIVE,MOLECULAR MARKER TOOLS FOR STRAWBERRY BREEDERS.",
