THIS PROJECT ESTABLISHES A SECURE, EASY-TO-USE ECOSYSTEM THAT (I) PROFILES MLLMS ON THEIR EFFECTIVENESS, ROBUSTNESS, EFFICIENCY, AND SECURITY, (II) RECOMMENDS THE BEST CANDIDATES FOR A GIVEN SCIENTIFIC TASK, AND (III) EMBEDS AUTOMATED SAFEGUARDS SO DISCOVERIES REMAIN REPRODUCIBLE AND TRUSTWORTHY.

THIS PROJECT ADVANCES THE RELIABILITY AND USABILITY OF FOUNDATIONAL AI MODELS SUCH AS MLLMS FOR THE SCIENTIFIC ECOSYSTEM BY ADDRESSING KEY CHALLENGES IN MODEL SELECTION, THREAT DISCOVERY AND SAFEGUARD, AS WELL AS FOOD SCIENCE RESEARCH APPLICATIONS. IT INTRODUCES PRINCIPLED METHODS FOR PROFILING AND RECOMMENDATION THAT ENCODES BOTH SCIENTIFIC TASKS AND CANDIDATE MLLMS INTO A SHARED SPACE AND RANKS MODELS THAT BEST MEET DOMAIN OBJECTIVES, ENABLING RIGOROUS AND TASK-RELEVANT MODEL RECOMMENDATION.
