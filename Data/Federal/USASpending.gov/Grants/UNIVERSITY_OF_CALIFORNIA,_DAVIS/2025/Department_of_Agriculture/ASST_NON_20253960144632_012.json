OPERATIONAL AND PHYSICALBIOSECURITY), THE POSITIVE PREDICTIVE VALUE OF AN HPAI OUTBREAK AT THE FARM LEVEL INCREASED BY 3.5X.HERE WE PROPOSE TO COMPREHENSIVELY EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ON-FARM AND OFF-FARM RISKFACTORS ON OVER 9,000 PREMISES IN 30 STATES. SPECIFICALLY, AN AGENT-BASED MODEL FOR PREDICTION OFHPAI RISK FROM WATERFOWL WILL BE COMBINED WITH STANDARDIZED BIOSECURITY SCORING TO PREDICT OVERALLRISK TO COMMERCIAL POULTRY FACILITIES. THIS RISK MODEL WILL BE INTEGRATED INTO AN EXISTING COMMERCIALWEB-TOOL (WATERFOWLALERTNETWORK) WHERE UTILIZATION OF THE TOOL AND ADOPTION OF BEST PRACTICESSUGGESTED BY THE MODEL WILL BE EVALUATED AT A COMPANY, INDUSTRY AND GOVERNMENT LEVEL.
