ACTIVITIES:THIS PROJECT WILL 1) BUILD A COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE TO UNDERSTAND THE DISTRIBUTION OF WILDFIRE-RELATED AIR POLLUTION IN CALIFORNIA ACROSS A RANGE OF FAMILY, NEIGHBORHOOD, AND COMMUNITY FACTORS THAT COULD INDICATE INCREASED VULNERABILITY; 2) EXAMINE PERINATAL WILDFIRE EXPOSURES IN ASSOCIATION WITH BIRTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING GESTATIONAL AGE AND WEIGHT AT BIRTH; 3) LINK EXPOSURES TO CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES DATA TO EVALUATE ASSOCIATIONS WITH DIAGNOSES OF AUTISM AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS; AND 4) EVALUATE EXPOSURE WINDOWS, EXPOSURE MIXTURES, AND COMPOUNDING VULNERABILITY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RISK.SUBRECIPIENT:UCLA ($100,001) WILL EVALUATE EXPOSURE WINDOWS, EXPOSURE\nMIXTURES, AND COMPOUNDING VULNERABILITY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RISK.
