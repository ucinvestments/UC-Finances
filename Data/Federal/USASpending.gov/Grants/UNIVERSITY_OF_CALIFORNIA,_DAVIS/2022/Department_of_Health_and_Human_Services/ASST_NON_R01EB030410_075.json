    "Description": "AN INTEGRATED IN VITRO 3D MODEL OF HUMAN BONE MARROW AND PERIPHERAL INFECTION - PROJECT SUMMARY THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE SUPPLEMENT TO BE CARRIED OUT BY MS. ZARATE-SANCHEZ IS TO DESIGN, BUILD, AND VALIDATE AN INTEGRATED “ORGAN-ON-A-CHIP” PLATFORM OF HUMAN PRIMARY TUMOR AND HUMAN BONE MARROW. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE: 1) ALL TUMORS ENGAGE THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, AND THUS THE BONE MARROW (PRIMARY SOURCE OF IMMUNE CELLS); AND 2) A WIDE RANGE OF TUMORS CO-OPT THE BONE MARROW TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE TUMOR DURING PROGRESSION AND LATENCY (E.G., BREAST CANCER). THE RESEARCH MILESTONES INCLUDE: 1) DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY IN ALL STEPS OF SOFT LITHOGRAPHY, INCLUDING CAD DESIGN, PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY, AND PDMS DEVICE CONSTRUCTION; 2) DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY IN CELL CULTURE TECHNIQUES; AND LOADING AND CULTURE OF IN VITRO BONE MARROW AND CANCER MODELS IN THE MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE; 3) QUANTIFY NUMBER, PHENOTYPE, AND LOCATION OF THE LEUKOCYTES WITHIN THE MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE IN RESPONSE TO A SERIES OF BREAST CANCER CELL LINES; AND 4) QUANTIFY NUMBER, PHENOTYPE, AND LOCATION OF A SERIES OF BREAST CANCER CELLS LINES IN THE MICROFLUIDIC DEVICE. IN ADDITION TO THE RESEARCH MILESTONES, THE SUPPLEMENT WILL SEEK TO ACCOMPLISH A SERIES OF MILESTONES ASSOCIATED WITH HER CAREER DEVELOPMENT INCLUDING: 1) COMPLETING 3 ELECTIVE COURSES; 2) MENTORING UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCHERS; 3) PRESENTING HER WORK AT A NATIONAL MEETING; 4) PUBLISHING HER WORK IN A PEER-REVIEWED ARCHIVED JOURNAL(S); AND 5) SUBMITTING HER OWN INDEPENDENT F31 APPLICATION. ACCOMPLISHING THESE MILESTONES WILL PREPARE MS. ZARATE-SANCHEZ FOR AN INDEPENDENT AND IMPACTFUL SCIENTIFIC CAREER.",
