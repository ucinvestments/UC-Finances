    "Description": "NOVEL THERAPEUTICS DUAL TARGETING INTRACRINE ANDROGEN SYNTHESIS AND AR FOR ADVANCED PROSTATE CANCER - ABSTRACT CONTINUED EXPRESSION OF ANDROGEN RECEPTOR (AR) AND ITS VARIANTS, SUCH AS AR-V7, DESPITE AR TARGETED THERAPY CONTRIBUTES TO TREATMENT RESISTANCE AND CANCER PROGRESSION IN ADVANCED CRPC PATIENTS. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR NEW STRATEGIES TO BLOCK CONTINUED AR SIGNALING. ALDO-KETO REDUCTASE FAMILY 1 MEMBER C3 (AKR1C3) IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GENES INVOLVED IN ANDROGEN SYNTHESIS AND METABOLISM. ACTIVITY OF THIS ENZYME CANNOT BE INHIBITED BY ABIRATERONE. BOTH AR/AR-V7 AND AKR1C3 PLAY KEY ROLES IN CANCER PROGRESSION AND DRIVING RESISTANCE TO CURRENT THERAPIES. THEREFORE, INHIBITION OF BOTH AR/AR-V7 AND AKR1C3 WOULD BE AN IDEAL STRATEGY FOR TREATING ADVANCED PROSTATE CANCER (PCA). WE HAVE DESIGNED A NOVEL STRATEGY TO SIMULTANEOUSLY TARGET THE AR/AR-V7 AND AKR1C3 PATHWAYS. WE DESIGNED AND SYNTHESIZED A LIBRARY OF NOVEL DUAL AKR1C3/AR/AR-VARIANT INHIBITORS, CALLED LX, ACCORDING TO STRUCTURE-BASED COMPUTER MODELING. OF THE LX COMPOUNDS, LX-1 HAD THE GREATEST EFFECT AT REDUCING CELL NUMBER, AR/AR VARIANT EXPRESSION, AND AKR1C3 ACTIVITY. RNA-SEQ ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED A ROBUST REDUCTION IN EXPRESSION OF AR AND AR-V7 SIGNALING GENES BY THE SELECTED LX. LX-1 INHIBITED CONVERSION OF THE TESTOSTERONE PRECURSOR ANDROSTENEDIONE INTO TESTOSTERONE IN TUMOR CELLS WHICH EXPRESS HIGH LEVELS OF AKR1C3 IN A DOSE-DEPENDENT MANNER EX VIVO. FURTHERMORE, TREATMENT WITH LX-1 REDUCED TUMOR GROWTH IN VCAP AND LUCAP35CR PDX XENOGRAFTS IN VIVO AND DECREASED INTRATUMORAL TESTOSTERONE. BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, THE OVERALL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT CONCURRENT INHIBITION OF AR/AR VARIANTS AND AKR1C3 USING NOVEL LX DUAL INHIBITOR SUPPRESSES CRPC TUMOR GROWTH, OVERCOMES RESISTANCE AND IMPROVES TREATMENT RESPONSE TO ENZALUTAMIDE/ABIRATERONE. THIS PROJECT IS TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE LX BY UNDERSTANDING ITS MECHANISM OF ACTION (MOA), DETERMINING ITS EFFICACY, PHARMACOKINETICS AND TOXICITY, AND TO DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTS ON THE SENSITIVITY TO ANTI-ANDROGEN THERAPY WITH THE GOAL TO TRANSLATE TO FUTURE CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT TO TREAT ADVANCED PCA. WE HOPE THAT COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED STUDIES WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW CLASS OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS THAT TARGET BOTH INTRACRINE ANDROGEN SYNTHESIS AND THE AR SIGNALING.",
