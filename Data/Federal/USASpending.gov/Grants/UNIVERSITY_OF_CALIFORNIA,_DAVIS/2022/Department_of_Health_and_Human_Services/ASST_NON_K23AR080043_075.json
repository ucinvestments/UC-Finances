    "Description": "A CLINICAL TRIAL FOR PSORIASIS WITH NOVEL SINGLE-CELL GENOMIC TECHNIQUES TO UNDERSTAND REGULATORY IMMUNITY BEHIND LONG-TERM DISEASE REMISSION OFF DRUG INDUCED BY SHORT-TERM IL-23 INHIBITION - ALTHOUGH HIGHLY EFFECTIVE, BIOLOGICS TARGETING IL-23/TH17 AXIS SHOULD BE CONTINUOUSLY INJECTED TO SUPPRESS RECURRENCE OF PSORIASIS. MY LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO CURE PSORIASIS WITHOUT RECURRENCE GUIDED BY PERSONAL IMMUNE TOLERANCE. THE OVERALL OBJECTIVES IN THIS APPLICATION ARE TO (I) IDENTIFY REGULATORY IMMUNE CELL INTERACTIONS INDUCED BY ANTI-IL-23P19 ANTIBODY ADMINISTRATION IN THE SKIN OF PATIENTS WHOSE PSORIASIS IS CLEARED WITHOUT RECURRENCE AND (II) DEVELOP PRE-TREATMENT PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR PSORIASIS PATIENTS THAT ANTICIPATE DISEASE RECURRENCE AFTER SHORT-TERM ANTI-IL-23P19 ANTIBODY INJECTION. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS IS THAT IL-23P19 INHIBITION PROMOTES REGULATORY IMMUNE CELLS IN PSORIASIS PATIENTS WHOSE DISEASE IS CLEARED WITHOUT RECURRENCE, AND THEIR PRE-TREATMENT SINGLE-CELL IMMUNE SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF PATIENTS WHOSE DISEASE RECURS. THE RATIONALE FOR THIS PROJECT IS THAT MOLECULAR EVIDENCE OF IMMUNE TOLERANCE INDUCTION BY IL-23P19 INHIBITION IN HUMAN SKIN IS LIKELY TO OFFER A STRONG CLINICAL FRAMEWORK WHEREBY NEW STRATEGIES TO PREVENT RECURRENCE OF CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES CAN BE DEVELOPED. THE CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS WILL BE TESTED BY PURSUING TWO SPECIFIC AIMS: 1) TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT REGULATORY IMMUNE CELL INTERACTIONS ARE PROMOTED BY SHORT-TERM ANTI-IL-23P19 ANTIBODY ADMINISTRATION IN THE SKIN OF PSORIASIS PATIENTS WHOSE DISEASE BECOMES CLEAR WITHOUT RECURRENCE; AND 2) DEVELOPING PREDICTIVE MODELS WITH PRETREATMENT SKIN BIOPSY SINGLE-CELL GENOMIC DATA THAT ANTICIPATE LONG-TERM DISEASE CLEARANCE OFF DRUG AFTER SHORT-TERM ANTI-IL-23P19 ANTIBODY ADMINISTRATION. TO ACHIEVE THE SPECIFIC AIMS, WE HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED TWO INNOVATIVE COMPLEMENTARY SINGLE-CELL APPROACHES TO OBTAIN GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES OF HETEROGENEOUS IMMUNE CELLS FROM PSORIASIS AND CONTROL SKIN WITHOUT ENZYME DIGESTION. THE FIRST SINGLE-CELL EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH IS MICROFLUIDIC PARTITIONING OF EMIGRATING CELLS FROM HUMAN SKIN AFTER 48-HOUR INCUBATION IN CULTURE MEDIUM WITHOUT ENZYME DIGESTION, WHICH EMPOWERS SINGLE-CELL TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILING OF HETEROGENEOUS IMMUNE CELLS AND KERATINOCYTES IN DIFFERENT LAYERS OF EPIDERMIS UNDER EX VIVO CONDITION. THE SECOND SINGLE-CELL EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH IS COMBINATORIAL INDEXING RNA SEQUENCING, DEVELOPED BY THE CO-MENTOR OF THE PROPOSAL, WHICH ENABLES CO-PROFILING TRANSCRIPTOME AND SINGLE-CELL CHROMATIN ACCESSIBILITY. AT THE COMPLETION OF THE PROPOSED RESEARCH, OUR EXPECTED OUTCOMES ARE TO HAVE NOVEL SINGLE-CELL GENOMIC TECHNIQUES TO STUDY IMMUNE CELL INTERACTIONS IN HUMAN SKIN, DEFINED SINGLE-CELL GENE SIGNATURES OF REGULATORY IMMUNE CELLS THAT ARE PROMOTED BY ANTI-IL-23P19 ANTIBODY ADMINISTRATION IN PSORIASIS SKIN, AND THE ABILITY TO ELUCIDATE HOW PATHOLOGIC IMMUNITY IS SUPPRESSED AT THE SINGLE-CELL LEVEL BY HIGHLY EFFECTIVE BIOLOGICS. WE ALSO EXPECT TO HAVE PRE-TREATMENT BIOMARKERS THAT CAN PREDICT LONG-TERM DISEASE CLEARANCE OFF DRUGS AFTER SHORT-TERM ANTI-IL-23P19 ANTIBODY ADMINISTRATION.",
