ALL THREE OUTBREAKS ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE ORIGINATED AND/OR WORSENED AS A RESULT OF THE ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH BYP AND GAMEFOWL (GF). DUE TO THE UNIQUE SPATIO-TEMPORAL AND CULTURAL INTERACTIVITY OF BYP-GF AND COMMERCIAL POULTRY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, TRADITIONAL METHODS OF CONTROL INCLUDING BIOSECURITY, DEPOPULATION AND EXTENSION HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY INEFFECTIVE. THE VALUE OF REAL-TIME SOCIAL MEDIA ANALYSES COUPLED WITH DISEASE MODELING TO IMPROVE PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE FOR VND COULD OFFER SIGNIFICANT NEW APPLIED RESEARCH AND EXTENSION TOOLS.
