    "Description": "TO SAFELY EXECUTE THE HUMAN-EXPLORATION MISSIONS CURRENTLY BEING PROPOSED BY NASA  THE DESIGN OF DEEP-SPACE HABITATS REQUIRES A FUNDAMENTALLY DISRUPTIVE APPROACH   ONE THAT RELIES NOT ONLY ON TRADITIONAL SUBSYSTEM RELIABILITY ENGINEERING AND PROBABILISTIC RISK ANALYSIS  BUT ON EMERGENT TECHNOLOGIES IN AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS  FAILURE-TOLERANT DESIGN  HUMAN/AUTOMATION TEAMING  DENSE SENSOR POPULATIONS  DATA SCIENCE  MACHINE LEARNING  ROBOTIC MAINTENANCE  AND ON-BOARD MANUFACTURING. ACCORDINGLY  THE HOME STRI FOR DEEP SPACE HABITAT DESIGN WILL SYNTHESIZE THE IDEAS AND BACKGROUNDS OF A UNIQUELY EXPERIENCED  DIVERSE  AND OPERATIONALLY PRAGMATIC RESEARCH TEAM WITH INITIALLY-LOW TRL INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE A 5-YEAR FLOW OF RESEARCH DELIVERABLES THAT COMPRISE A NEW PARADIGM FOR RESILIENT  AUTONOMOUS  AND SELF-MAINTAINED DEEP-SPACE HABITATS FOR HUMAN EXPLORERS. THE SCOPE OF THE HOME STRI S RESEARCH WILL BE DRIVEN BY THE TWO PRIMARY OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS OF DEEP-SPACE HABITATS: 1) KEEP HUMANS ALIVE WHILE THEY ARE RESIDENT 2) KEEP THE VEHICLE ALIVE WHILE THEY ARE NOT.  THE PRIMARY DELIVERABLE OF THE HOME STRI RESEARCH IS A CLASS OF NOVEL DESIGN METHODOLOGIES  BEST PRACTICES  AND ANALOG-VALIDATED DESIGN TOOLS. OUR APPROACH WILL DRAW FROM FUNCTION-BASED ANALYSIS OF THE SPACECRAFT AND TASK ALLOCATION OPTIONS  FROM WHICH A COMBINATION OF CURRENT VALIDATED TECHNOLOGIES EXTENDED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MODERN DEVELOPMENTS IN AUTONOMY  SYSTEM RESILIENCE  SELF-MAINTENANCE  ROBOTICS  AND AI WILL BE IDENTIFIED  EVALUATED AND DEMONSTRATED. THIS FUNCTIONAL-NEEDS BASED APPROACH TO SMARTHAB DESIGN RESULTS IN THE FOLLOWING BROAD CATEGORIES OF RESEARCH: A. AUTONOMOUS FUNCTIONALITY B. VEHICLE SYSTEMS ENGINEERING  FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS  OPERATIONS CONCEPT C. HUMAN HABITABILITY D. ROBUST/RELIABLE VEHICLE OPERABILITY.  OUR GUIDING PHILOSOPHY IS INTELLIGENT APPLICATION OF SMART-SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY. ACCORDINGLY  IN EACH OF THE ABOVE RESEARCH TOPICS  THE HOME STRI WILL INCORPORATE STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGIES (FROM THE FIELDS OF SPACEFLIGHT  AVIATION  MANUFACTURING  BUILDING SCIENCE  ROBOTICS  MEDICINE) AND THEN WILL PUSH BEYOND CURRENT PRACTICE TO FORMULATE MISSION-RELEVANT NEW RESEARCH WITH A CONVERGENT FOCUS ON AN INTELLIGENTLY-AUTONOMOUS  FUNCTIONALLY-DRIVEN  REALISTICALLY-ACHIEVABLE HABITAT DESIGN.",
