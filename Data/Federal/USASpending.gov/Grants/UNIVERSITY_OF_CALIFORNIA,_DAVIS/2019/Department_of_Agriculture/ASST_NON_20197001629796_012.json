    "Description": "HUANGLONGBING (HLB) IS CURRENTLY THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE DISEASE OF CITRUS. THERE IS AN URGENT NEED TO DEVELOP THERAPIES TO TREAT HLB IN EXISTING GROVES AND DEVELOP CITRUS WITH RESISTANCE TO THIS DISEASE. PLANTS CAN RECOGNIZE DIVERSE PATHOGENS USING IMMUNE RECEPTORS. SURFACE LOCALIZED RECEPTORS CAN RECOGNIZE CONSERVED PATHOGEN FEATURES AND ACTIVATE DEFENSE RESPONSES. PATHOGEN FEATURES ARE CALLED PATHOGEN ASSOCIATED MOLECULAR PATTERNS (PAMPS); PAMP PERCEPTION LEADS TO PATTERN-TRIGGERED IMMUNITY. PATTERN-TRIGGERED IMMUNITY INDUCES IMMEDIATE DEFENSE RESPONSES AND PROTECTS AGAINST SUBSEQUENT INFECTION.THE OVERALL GOALS OF THE PROJECT ARE TO HARNESS PATTERN-TRIGGERED IMMUNE RESPONSES TO CONTROL HLB AND DEVELOP RESISTANT CITRUS. PAMPS PERCEIVED IN CULTIVATED CITRUS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP THERAPIES TO BOOST CITRUS DEFENSE AND INDUCE HLB RESISTANCE IN EXISTING GROVES. WE WILL IDENTIFY AND TEST PATHOGEN PAMPS FOR THEIR PERCEPTION IN CITRUS RELATIVES WITH HLB RESISTANCE FOR USE AS MARKERS TO ACCELERATE CITRUS BREEDING. WE WILL EMPLOY STATE-OF-THE ART BIOTECHNOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO TRANSFER STACKS OF IMMUNE RECEPTORS INTO CITRUS VARIETIES TO GENERATE HLB RESISTANT MATERIAL. FURTHERMORE, WE WILL LEVERAGE MULTIPLE APPROACHES TO ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS AND EDUCATE END-USERS (CITRUS INDUSTRY, GROWERS, BREEDERS, RESIDENTIAL CITRUS OWNERS, AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY) OF OUR PROJECT FINDINGS. WE WILL USE A VARIETY OF MULTI-MEDIA OUTLETS AND CONNECTIONS WITH OUR EXTENSION TEAM IN FLORIDA, TEXAS, AND CALIFORNIA. TAKEN TOGETHER, THE COMPLETION OF THESE EXPERIMENTS WILL FACILITATE NEAR TERM SOLUTIONS FOR HLB MANAGEMENT WHILE ACCELERATING BREEDING EFFORTS FOR DELIVERY OF NEW DISEASE RESISTANT CULTIVARS.",
