    "Description": "EPIGENETIC GENE REGULATION IN THE GERMLINE - ONE OF THE GREATEST MYSTERIES IN BIOLOGY CONCERNS HOW LIFE HAS PERPETUATED, AND CONTINUES TO  PERPETUATE, FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION. A KEY FEATURE OF THE MAMMALIAN GERMLINE IS  ITS SEXUAL DIMORPHISM: SPERMATOGENESIS AND OOGENESIS. THESE DIMORPHIC DEVELOPMENTAL  PROCESSES ARE INHERENTLY COMPLEX, AND THIS COMPLEXITY POSES SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO  UNDERSTANDING THE PERPETUITY OF LIFE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF TREATMENTS FOR VARIOUS GERMLINE-DERIVED  GENETIC AND EPIGENETIC DISEASES. THUS, IN THIS R35 APPLICATION, OUR RESEARCH DIRECTIONS CONVERGE  TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: HOW DO EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS GOVERN DISTINCT SEXUALLY  DIMORPHIC PROCESSES IN SPERMATOGENESIS AND OOGENESIS, CULMINATING IN THE GENERATION OF FUNCTIONAL  SPERM AND EGGS? SINCE I BECAME INDEPENDENT TEN YEARS AGO, I AND MY TEAM HAVE WORKED TO CONSTRUCT   A DETAILED PICTURE OF THE EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS THAT GOVERN MAMMALIAN SPERMATOGENESIS. WE  HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MITOSIS-TO-MEIOSIS TRANSITION IN GERM CELL DEVELOPMENT IS NOTABLE FOR NOT ONLY  GLOBAL CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION BUT THE DYNAMIC REORGANIZATION OF THE EPIGENOME; IN BRIEF, WE  HAVE REVEALED THAT MEIOSIS ITSELF IS A PROCESS OF GLOBAL EPIGENOMIC REPROGRAMMING. MY RESEARCH  PROGRAM HAS PIONEERED THESE CONCEPTS AND DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO DECODE GERMLINE  MECHANISMS CRUCIAL FOR PREPARING THE NEXT GENERATION, PROVIDING A RIGOROUS FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE  RESEARCH. TO UNDERSTAND KEY SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC PROCESSES, WE FOCUS ON FUNDAMENTAL  PROCESSES IN SPERMATOGENESIS AND OOGENESIS. IN SPERMATOGENESIS, POSTNATAL GERM CELLS ENTER A STEM  CELL STAGE, UNDERGO MEIOSIS, AND SUSTAIN LONG-TERM PRODUCTION OF SPERM. WE WILL ELUCIDATE THE  GLOBAL EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING SPERMATOGENESIS FROM THE STEM CELL STAGE TO SPERM  PRODUCTION, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DYNAMIC CHANGES IN THE EPIGENETIC MACHINERY AND THEIR  IMPORTANCE TO THE NEXT GENERATION. SINCE, IN MALES, MEIOTIC SEX CHROMOSOME INACTIVATION (MSCI)  FUNCTIONS AS A KEY SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC PROCESS, WE WILL ALSO DETERMINE THE MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS OF  DNA DAMAGE RESPONSE PATHWAYS-WHICH DIRECT MSCL-IN THE EPIGENETIC REGULATION OF THE SEX CHROMOSOMES.  IN CONTRAST, FEMALE GERM CELLS UNDERGO MEIOSIS IN EMBRYOS AND ENTER A PROLONGED STAGE OF  MEIOTIC ARREST-SPANNING DECADES IN HUMANS-PRIOR TO OOCYTE MATURATION. WE WILL DETERMINE  EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING CRITICAL STAGES OF OOGENESIS TO COMPLEMENT OUR STUDY OF  MALE GERM CELLS. ULTIMATELY, WE WILL REVEAL DISTINCT FEATURES AND UNIFYING PRINCIPLES OF  SPERMATOGENESIS AND OOGENESIS. TAKING ALL OF THIS TOGETHER, WE ARE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO CLARIFY  HOW FUNDAMENTAL GERMLINE MECHANISMS INTERSECT TO ENSURE GENOME MAINTENANCE, GENOME DEFENSE, AND  EPIGENETIC GENE REGULATION ON A SYSTEMIC LEVEL. THE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS PROPOSED IN THIS  APPLICATION ARE COHESIVE AND SYNERGISTIC, WITH HIGH POTENTIAL TO SUSTAIN RESEARCH  PROGRESS AND INFORM SIGNIFICANT, TRANSFORMATIVE ADVANCES IN GERMLINE BIOLOGY, HUMAN  REPRODUCTION, AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN GENERAL.",
