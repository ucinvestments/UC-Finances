    "Description": "MENTORING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENTISTS IN CLINICAL TRIAL IMMUNE MONITORING - TITLE: MENTORING PHYSICIAN SCIENTISTS IN PATIENT-ORIENTED RESEARCH ABSTRACT DR. MAVERAKIS IS A PHYSICIAN-SCIENTIST TRAINED IN IMMUNOGENETICS, GLYCOBIOLOGY, AND BIG DATA ANALYTICS. HIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON THE USE OF STATE-OF-THE-ART METHODOLOGIES TO STUDY PATIENTS WITH AUTOIMMUNITY AND CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING IMMUNOTHERAPY. HIS GROUP CONSTRUCTS DIAGNOSTIC CLASSIFIERS, AS WELL AS PREDICTIVE CLASSIFIERS TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO WILL: EXPERIENCE A PROGRESSION IN DISEASE SEVERITY, RESPOND TO A PARTICULAR THERAPY, OR DEVELOP AN ASSOCIATED DISEASE. WITH THIS GOAL IN MIND, DR. MAVERAKIS AND HIS COLLABORATOR, CARLITO LEBRILLA, HAVE CREATED A SITE-SPECIFIC MAP OF THE HUMAN SERUM GLYCOME FOR USE IN BIOMARKER RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY. DR. MAVERAKIS IS AN AWARD-WINNING MENTOR WITH A STRONG TRACK-RECORD OF TRAINING CLINICAL-INVESTIGATORS. HE IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE UC DAVIS IMMUNE MONITORING SHARED RESOURCE AND IN THIS CAPACITY, IS CHARGED WITH MENTORING YOUNG CLINICAL-SCIENTISTS, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO CLINICAL TRIAL ANCILLARY STUDY DESIGN. AN NIH K24 AWARD WILL BE INTEGRAL TO HIS FUTURE DEVELOPMENT AS A SUCCESSFUL MENTOR TO YOUNG CLINICAL-INVESTIGATORS. IT WILL ENSURE THAT HE HAS PROTECTED TIME TO TEACH AND MENTOR CLINICAL- INVESTIGATORS FROM VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS TO HELP THEM OBTAIN RESEARCH INDEPENDENCE. HE PRESENTS A PLAN FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF HIS MENTORING, INCLUDING EXTENDING HIS MENTORING ACTIVITIES TO OTHER ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, DR. MAVERAKIS PROPOSES TO AUGMENT HIS CURRENT PATIENT-ORIENTED-RESEARCH BY DESIGNING AND CONDUCTING EARLY STAGE CLINICAL STUDIES TO EXPLORE NOVEL TREATMENTS AND THEIR BIOMECHANISMS.",
