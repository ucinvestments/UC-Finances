THE TRAUMA AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL ILLNESS (TAMI) SERVICES PROJECT TRIPLES THE CAPACITY OF SERVICE PROVIDERS IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY, CA, TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED SERVICES FOR YOUTH (AGE 12-22) WITH COMORBID TRAUMA AND PSYCHOSIS IN JJ, CW, AND CMH SETTINGS. PROJECT GOALS ARE: 1) INCREASE CAPACITY OF CHILD-SERVING SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY AND APPROPRIATELY LINK YOUTH EXPERIENCING TRAUMA AND PSYCHOSIS SYMPTOMS BY IMPLEMENTING A UNIVERSAL SCREENING AND REFERRAL PROTOCOL IN SAC COUNTY JJ AND CW SETTINGS; 2) INCREASE THE CAPACITY OF SAC COUNTY CMH SERVICES TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED TRAUMA-FOCUSED CARE FOR YOUTH WITH COMORBID TRAUMA AND PSYCHOSIS BY IMPLEMENTING A CURRICULUM THAT ADDRESSES THE TRAINING NEEDS OF CMH PROVIDERS.
