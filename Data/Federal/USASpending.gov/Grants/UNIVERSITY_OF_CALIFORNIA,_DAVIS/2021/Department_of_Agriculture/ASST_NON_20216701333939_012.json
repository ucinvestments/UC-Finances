FOR INBRED DIVERSITY PANELS OF HIGH RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC BREEDING PROGRAMS IN THESE TWO REGIONS--THE LATTER THROUGH A PLANT BREEDING PARTNERSHIP--WE WILL EVALUATE NUTRITIONAL QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY UNDER OPTIMAL AND MANAGED PRE-ANTHESIS DROUGHT CONDITIONS, IN THREE HIGH-QUALITY TESTING ENVIRONMENTS.
