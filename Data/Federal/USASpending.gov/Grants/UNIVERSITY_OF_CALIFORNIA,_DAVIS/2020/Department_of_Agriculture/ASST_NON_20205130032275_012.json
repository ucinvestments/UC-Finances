    "Description": "ORGANIC FARMING SYSTEMS ARE DISTINCT FROM CONVENTIONAL FARMING SYSTEMS. CONSEQUENTLY, PLANT BREEDING ACTIVITIES FOCUSED IN ORGANIC FARMING SYSTEMS WILL RESULT IN CULTIVARS WELL TAILORED TO PRODUCTION NEEDS OF THOSE SYSTEMS, SUCH AS IMPROVED DISEASE RESISTANCE OR NOVEL TRAITS. FURTHER, A RANGE OF NICHE CONSUMER MARKETS EXISTS FOR ORGANIC PRODUCERS, INCLUDING NEW AND NOVEL TRAITS OR TRAIT COMBINATIONS. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS PROGRAM ARE TO BREED NEW VARIETIES OF COMMON BEAN, PEPPER, TOMATO, WHEAT, AND ZINNIA FOR ORGANIC PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA AND NEIGHBORING STATES. THIS PROJECT BUILDS ON OUR OREI-FUNDED, EXISTING SUCCESSFUL BREEDING PIPELINES THAT ARE LED BY STUDENTS WHO GAIN EXPERIENTIAL TRAINING IN FIELD-BASED PLANT BREEDING DIRECTLY IN ORGANIC SYSTEMS, BOTH AT THE UC-DAVIS AND CAL POLY POMONA ORGANIC STUDENT FARMS AND ON-FARM WITH ORGANIC PRODUCERS. WITH BOTH SELF- AND CROSS-FERTILIZED CROPS AND VEGETABLE, AGRONOMIC, AND ORNAMENTAL SPECIES, STUDENTS WILL GAIN FAMILIARITY WITH A BROAD COMPLEMENT OF BREEDING SYSTEMS AND VARIETY TYPES, INCLUDING OPEN-POLLINATED AND HYBRID CULTIVARS AND DEVELOP NEW CULTIVARS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF DIVERSE ORGANIC GROWERS. THE ORGANIC SEED ALLIANCE WILL ORGANIZE REGULAR INTERACTIONS AND MEETINGS BETWEEN STUDENT RESEARCHERS, FACULTY, ORGANIC SEED COMPANIES, AND ORGANIC GROWERS. WE WILL DEVELOP AND CONDUCT ON-FARM TRIALS, HOST EXTENSION EVENTS AT TRIAL SITES, AND ENSURE THAT NEW, PUBLICLY RELEASED CULTIVARS DERIVED FROM OUR PROGRAM WILL BE USEFUL AND AVAILABLE TO ORGANIC GROWERS AND ORGANIC SEED COMPANIES.",
