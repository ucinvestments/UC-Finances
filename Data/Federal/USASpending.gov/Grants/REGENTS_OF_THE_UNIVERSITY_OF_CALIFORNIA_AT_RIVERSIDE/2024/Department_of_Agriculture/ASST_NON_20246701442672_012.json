    "Description": "CALIFORNIA IS THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPION OF AVOCADO GROWING IN THE US, PRODUCING 95% OF THE COUNTRY\u0026#39;S CROP WORTH AROUND $400 MILLION ANNUALLY. AVOCADO INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IMPACTED BYAVOCADO SUNBLOTCH VIROID DISEASE (ASBVD) FOR OVER A CENTURY. WHILE ASBVD DOESN\u0026#39;T KILL THE TREES, IT STUNTS THEIR GROWTH AND SLASHES FRUIT PRODUCTION BY A MASSIVE 95%, IMPACTING THE FRUIT\u0026#39;S APPEARANCE AND MARKETABILITY. DETECTING ASBVD IS CURRENTLY DIFFICULTDUE TO THE UNEVEN SPREAD OF THE DISEASE WITHIN TREES AND THE EXISTENCE OF INFECTED BUT SYMPTOMLESS TREES. ONE OF THE MAJOR CHALLENGES TO PREVENTING THE SPREAD OF ASBVD IS THE LACK OF IDEAL RAPID, ACCURATE, AND SENSITIVE DETECTION OF PATHOGEN IN TREES AND NURSERY MATERIALS. THIS PROPOSALFOCUSES ON DEVELOPING A FAST, ACCURATE, AND HIGH THROUGHPUT METHOD, REFERRED TO AS ANC-NANO, TO DETECT ASBVD IN AVOCADO NURSERIES AND AVOCADO ORCHARDS IN CALIFORNIA TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE; AND TO DETECT THE DISEASE IN HONEYBEES (AVOCADO POLLINATORS) TO HELP EARLY DETECTION OF ASBVD IN ORCHARDS. WHILE THE TECHNICAL DETAILS INVOLVE RECOMBINASE POLYMERASE AMPLIFICATION, DNA TO NANOPARTICLE CONVERSION, AND NANOPORE ARRAY NANOPARTICLE OBSTRUCTION, THE KEY TAKEAWAY IS THAT ANC-NANO CAN FIND EVEN THE TINIEST TRACES OF VIROID DOWN TO 1 COPY/ML IN HUNDREDS OF SAMPLES SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS METHOD CAN ALSO BE USED FOR SENSITIVE AND MULTIPLEXED DETECTION OF OTHER FUNGAL AND VIRAL AVOCADO DISEASES. THIS REVOLUTIONARY TECHNOLOGY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM NOT JUST AVOCADO DISEASE DIAGNOSIS, BUT PLANT DISEASE DETECTION AS A WHOLE, POTENTIALLY LEADING TO BREAKTHROUGHS IN PLANT PATHOLOGY FIELD.",
