    "Description": "HONEY BEES ARE THE MOST ABUNDANT MANAGED POLLINATORS IN THE U.S. AND THEIR HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY IS ESSENTIAL FOR ENSURING RELIABLE FRUIT SETS, YIELD, AND SEED PRODUCTION OF NUMEROUS HIGH-VALUE CROPS. WORRYINGLY, TEMPERATURES RECORDED IN RECENT HEAT WAVES IMPAIR BEE SURVIVAL AND FERTILITY, AND SUCH CONDITIONS WILL BECOME MORE FREQUENT AND INTENSE IN THE FUTURE. OUR LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF IMPAIRED POLLINATION SERVICES DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE BY 1) IDENTIFYING COMMERCIALLY VIABLE HONEY BEE STOCKS THAT ARE RESILIENT TO HEAT, 2) DETERMINING THE UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS GOVERNING SEX- AND STOCK-SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF HEAT RESILIENCE, AND 3) EMPLOYING GENETIC MARKERS TO ENRICH HEAT RESILIENCE IN HONEY BEE POPULATIONS THROUGH SELECTIVE BREEDING. THE PROPOSED WORK WILL ADDRESS GOALS WITHIN THE AG2PI PROGRAM AREAS IN THE FOLLOWING WAYS:- WE WILL CONDUCT A MUCH-NEEDED SCREEN OF HEAT TOLERANCE PHENOTYPES ACROSS BREEDING POPULATIONS TO PRODUCE A BENCHMARK DATASET OF U.S. COMMERCIAL BEE STOCKS, AND USE THESE DATA TO IMPROVE ANIMAL MANAGEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN U.S. CLIMES.- WE WILL COMBINE GENOMIC, PROTEOMIC, AND METABOLOMIC DATA WITH SEX- AND STOCK-SPECIFIC HEAT RESILIENCE PHENOTYPES, LEADING TO A NOVEL UNDERSTANDING OF HOW HEAT AFFECTS HONEY BEE SURVIVAL, PHYSIOLOGY, AND THEIR ABILITY TO REPRODUCE.- WE WILL DEVELOP GENETIC MARKERS FOR HEAT RESILIENCE TO IMPROVE STOCK PERFORMANCE PREDICTIONS, AND USE THESE MARKERS TO ENRICH HEAT RESILIENCE IN A SELECTIVE BREEDING PROGRAM.THROUGH THESE ACTIVITIES, WE WILL ULTIMATELY HELP THE BEEKEEPING INDUSTRY MAKE CLIMATE-CONSCIOUS DECISIONS SECURING ESSENTIAL POLLINATION SERVICES UNDER CHANGING ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS.",
