    "Description": "THIS IS AN INTEGRATED PROJECT OF NEMATOLOGY, ECONOMICS AND DAIRY SCIENCE TO IMPLEMENT NOVEL PREPLANT SOIL TREATMENTS TO ALMOND AND WALNUT TO REDUCE THE NEGATIVE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE DISCONTINUATION OF METHYL BROMIDE. SINCE THE BAN OF SOIL FUMIGATION WITH METHYL BROMIDE FOR NEMATODE SUPPRESSION IN NUT CROPS IN 2005, 1,3-DICHLOROPROPENE (1,3-D) OFTEN IN COMBINATION WITH CHLOROPICRIN HAS BEEN USED. STRICT REGULATIONS BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH CONCERNS ENCUMBER THE EFFICACY AND ECONOMIC FEASIBILITY OF 1,3-D. ANAEROBIC SOIL DISINFESTATION (ASD), INCORPORATING EASILY DECOMPOSABLE ORGANIC MATTER INTO SOIL, MAINTAINING HIGH SOIL MOISTURE SATURATION WITH DRIP IRRIGATION LINES UNDER TOTALLY IMPERMEABLE FILM (TIF), WAS ADOPTED TO SUPPRESS PLANT-PARASITIC NEMATODES FOR NUT TREES. ASD WITH RICE BRAN AT 9 TON/A REDUCED NEMATODE POPULATIONS 5 FT DEEP BUT COST $6,000/A (SUBSTRATE: $3,000, TIF AND DRIP IRRIGATION: $2,000, AND APPLICATION AND TRASH REMOVAL: $1,000) MAKING IT NON-ECONOMICAL. TOMATO POMACE AND LIQUID MANURE COST LESS THAN RICE BRAN, E.G., ~1/2 TO 1/3 LESS (ON A DRY MATTER BASIS) FOR TOMATO POMACE. ANAEROBICALLY DIGESTED LIQUID DAIRY MANURE HAD SOME NEMATODE SUPPRESSIVE CAPACITY. APPLICATION SIMPLIFICATIONS ALLOWED FOREGOING THE USE OF TIF AND DRIP LINE WHILE COMBINING THE ENTIRE APPLICATION PROCESS IN A SINGLE FIELD PASS. IT IS THE AIM OF THIS PROJECT TO COMBINE THESE COST SAVINGS TO REDUCE EXPENSE OF ASD, AND MAKE THE METHOD HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH CUMBERSOME, INEFFECTIVE AND EXPENSIVE 1,3-D FUMIGATION. THIS PROJECT ALIGNS WITH THE METHYL BROMIDE TRANSITION PROGRAM BY FINDING ALTERNATIVE SOIL TREATMENT METHODS WITH LESS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT AND COMPETITIVE EFFICACY.",
