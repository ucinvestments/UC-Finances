ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) AND DIGITAL AGRICULTURE (DA), THE TRANSDISCIPLINARY APPLICATION OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING AND HYPERDIMENSIONAL DATA, CAN IMPROVE FARMING RESILIENCE. SHORT- AND MEDIUM-TERM, THIS PROJECT APPLIES DA TO OPTIMIZE CURRENT PRACTICES, MAXIMIZING EFFICIENCY, AND MINIMIZING WASTE. LONG-TERM, THE PROJECT DEVELOPS A FOUNDATION OF TOOLS AND KNOWLEDGE FOR A SHIFT TO HIGHLY-AUTOMATED MECHANIZED SYSTEMS FOR IRRIGATION, NUTRIENT, SALINITY, AND PEST MANAGEMENT. APPLIED RESEARCH SUPPORTING OBJECTIVES (SO) ARE SO1 -- A DECISION-SUPPORT TOOL FOR AGRICULTURAL INPUT MANAGEMENT WITH AI (AIM-AI) -- AND SO2 -- A TOOL FOR EARLY PEST DETECTION WITH AI (EPD-AI). TOOLS INTEGRATE PHYSICAL AND STATISTICAL MODELS, BIG-GEODATA (E.G., DAILY REMOTE SENSING), AND AI. SO1 WILL MERGE RECOMMENDATIONSFOR EVAPOTRANSPIRATION-BASED SOIL-WATER BALANCE IRRIGATION SCHEDULING, SALINITY LEACHING, AND FERTILIZATION INTO A SINGLE FRAMEWORK. IN SO2, AN AI CLASSIFIER WILL ESTIMATE PEST EMERGENCE IN ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL CROPS FOR TIMELY RESPONSE. AIM-AI AND EPD-AI WILL BE EVALUATED USING EXTENSIVE FIELD DATA. COOPERATIVE EXTENSION SOS WILL INFORM STAKEHOLDERS OF CURRENT RESEARCH-BASED TOOLS, KNOWLEDGE, AND ON-FARM PRACTICES (SO3), AND DISSEMINATE KNOWLEDGE FROM RESEARCH SOS (SO4) THROUGH TRAINING (FACE-TO-FACE AND ELECTRONIC), FIELD DAYS, PUBLICATIONS, AND SMARTPHONE AND WEB APPS. SO5 INCLUDES AN UNDERGRADUATE DA FELLOWSHIP TO EDUCATE FUTURE FARMERS, AND DA PROFESSIONALS AND ACADEMICS VIA STUDENT RESEARCH, MENTORSHIP, AND INDUSTRY EXTERNSHIPS. PROJECT SUCCESS IN FOSTERING RURAL PROSPERITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WILL BE EVALUATED BY STAKEHOLDERS, SCIENTISTS, AND PROFESSIONAL EVALUATORS.",
