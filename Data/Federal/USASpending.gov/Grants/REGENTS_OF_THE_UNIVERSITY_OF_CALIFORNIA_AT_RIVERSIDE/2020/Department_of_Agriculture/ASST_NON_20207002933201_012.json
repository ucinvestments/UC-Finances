    "Description": "CITRUS HUANGLONGBING (HLB) HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ALL THE MAJOR CITRUS GROWING AREAS OF THE WORLD. THE FINANCIAL LOSSES INCURRED DUE TO HLB HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE US ALONE. CITRUS IS AN IMPORTANT FOOD CROP AND CONSUMED WIDELY IN THE USA AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. THE FRUITS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE NUTRIENT-DENSE AND ARE RICH IN BENEFICIAL PHYTOCHEMICALS LIKE FLAVONOIDS, CAROTENOIDS, COUMARINS, TERPENES, AND LIMONOIDS. THE MEDICINAL PROPERTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CITRUS FRUITS PROTECT AGAINST SEVERAL CHRONIC DISEASES. CITRUS IS ALSO AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE DIET FOR MOST PEOPLE. JUICE DERIVED FROM VARIOUS TYPES OF CITRUS IS CONSUMED WIDELY. CULTIVATING CITRUS PROVIDES REVENUE THAT SUPPORTS MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRIES IN THE USA.THE DEVASTATION CAUSED BY HLB HAS NOW THREATENED THE CITRUS INDUSTRY IN FLORIDA. TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA, THE OTHER TWO PROMINENT CITRUS-PRODUCING STATES, ARE LIKELY TO BE IN A SIMILAR SITUATION IF THE DISEASE IS NOT CONTROLLED. DESPITE RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON HLB FOR THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS, TANGIBLE, PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO THE GROWERS. HLB IS APTLY DESCRIBED AS THE GREATEST THREAT TO CITRUS CULTIVATION IN THE USA. THE DISEASE COMPLEX IS COMPLICATED BECAUSE OF THE UNCULTIVABLE NATURE OF THE PATHOGEN (LEADING TO LACK OF UNDERSTANDING OF THE DISEASE ORGANISM), LATE SYMPTOM EXPRESSION (RESULTING IN THE SPREAD OF THE PATHOGEN BEFORE AN INFECTED PLANT CAN BE IDENTIFIED), AND, UNEQUAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE PATHOGEN IN THE HOST PLANTS (RESULTING IN SAMPLING ISSUES AND FALSE NEGATIVES IN HLB SURVEYS). IN ADDITION, THE WIDESPREAD DISTRIBUTION OF THE RAPIDLY PROLIFERATING PSYLLID VECTOR AND DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROLLING OF PSYLLID POPULATIONS CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO DEVELOPING PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS. SHORT-TERM DISEASE MANAGEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY CONTROLLING PSYLLIDS, PREVENTING SPREAD BY ADHERING TO PHYTOSANITARY PRACTICES, AND IMPLEMENTING STRICT REGULATIONS. ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AND FINANCIALLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS WILL BE NEEDED TO CONTINUE CITRUS CULTIVATION IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HLB ASSOCIATED PATHOGEN AND THE PSYLLID VECTOR. HLB HAS NOW ESTABLISHED IN THE THREE MAJOR CITRUS GROWING STATES OF THE USA. HLB DISEASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICES THAT ARE IN VOGUE ARE USEFUL FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY; LONG-TERM CONTROL OF HLB WILL REQUIRE GENETIC SOLUTIONS. THE MOST PROMISING SOLUTION IS TO DEVELOP DISEASE-RESISTANT CULTIVARS THAT PREVENT THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE ASSOCIATED PATHOGEN. SINCE THERE IS NO APPRECIABLE HLB RESISTANCE IN THE GENUS CITRUS, UTILIZING GENETIC RESOURCES OF WILD RELATIVES IS A VIABLE OPTION TO INTROGRESS RESISTANCE TRAITS INTO CULTIVATED CITRUS. WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY CHARACTERIZED HLB SENSITIVITY ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PHYLOGENETICALLY DIVERSE CITRUS AND RELATIVE GENERA UNDER FIELD CONDITIONS. WE HAVE REPORTED THAT AUSTRALIAN LIMES IN THE GROUPS MICROCITRUS AND EREMOCITRUS, THAT DIVERGED FROM THE MANDARIN LINEAGE APPROXIMATELY 6 MILLION YEARS AGO, HAVE HLB RESISTANCE TRAIT THAT IS SUPERIOR TO CITRUS. BUILDING ON THIS INSIGHT, WE CREATED CITRUS X MICROCITRUS HYBRIDS THAT POSSESS BOTH GOOD FRUIT QUALITY AND STRONG HLB RESISTANCE; THESE MATERIALS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF NEW HLB SOLUTIONS THAT WE EXPLOIT HERE TODEVELOP COMMERCIALLY ACCEPTABLE, NON-TRANSGENIC, HLB-RESISTANT CULTIVARS.OUR PROJECT BUILDS ON PREVIOUS WORK WHERE WE IDENTIFIED NATURAL SOURCES OF HLB RESISTANCE, BRED FOR NEW HLB RESISTANT VARIETIES, AND DEVELOPED THE GENOMIC RESOURCES REQUIRED FOR MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION OF HLB RESISTANCE. HERE, WE PROPOSE TO EVALUATE THE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL OF THESE BY CONDUCTING MULTI-SITE EVALUATIONS OF A LIMITED NUMBER OF HYBRIDS IN FLORIDA, TEXAS, AND CALIFORNIA. OUR PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP AN INTEGRATED PIPELINE THAT WILL ACCELERATE THE FARM-LEVEL IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR RESEARCH AND HASTEN THE TIME-LINES FOR TRANSITIONING THESE MATERIALS FROM THE LAB TO THE GROWER. OUR PIPELINE WILL ENABLE THE RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF VALUABLE HYBRIDS BY COMBINING MULTIPLE STRATEGIES INCLUDING THE USE OF PRECOCIOUS FRUITING TO ACCELERATE FRUIT EVALUATION, METABOLOMICS AND GENOMICS TO QUICKLY ELIMINATE UNDESIRABLE HYBRIDS, AND MULTI- LOCATION FIELD TRIALS TO ASSESS HLB RESISTANCE, HORTICULTURAL PERFORMANCE, AND CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE IN REAL-WORLD CONTEXTS. OUR APPROACH IS TO INCORPORATE RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED GENOMIC SEGMENTS FROM AUSTRALIAN LIMES TO CULTIVATED CITRUS TYPES. THE PROCESS OF SELECTING PROMISING HYBRIDS FROM BREEDING POPULATIONS IS GENERALLY TIME CONSUMING AND INVOLVES GREENHOUSE EVALUATIONS, PRELIMINARY HORTICULTURAL DATA, FIELD PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS OF SINGLE TREES AND FINALLY, BY MULTI-LOCATION FIELD TRIALS. WE ARE PROPOSING A FAST-TRACK APPROACH TO DELIVER NEW CULTIVARS WHERE MULTIPLE EVALUATIONS WILL BE CARRIED OUT IN PARALLEL TO HASTEN THE PROCESS OF VARIETY DEVELOPMENT. MOLECULAR DATA (GENOMIC AND METABOLOMIC) DEVELOPED IN A COMPLEMENTARY PROJECT AND PHYTOPATHOLOGICAL DATA PROPOSED IN THE CURRENT PROJECT WILL BE USED TO SELECT ADVANCED HYBRIDS THAT MAY HAVE COMMERCIAL POTENTIAL.THROUGH THIS PROJECT, WE WILL BE ABLE TO EVALUATE THE FIELD PERFORMANCE OF FOUR F1 HYBRIDS IN SIX LOCATIONS AND IDENTIFY ADVANCED HYBRIDS WITH RESISTANCE TRAITS INCORPORATED. THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO ACCELERATE CITRUS BREEDING AND DEVELOP TOOLS FOR SELECTION OF USEFUL HYBRIDS WITH PUTATIVE COMMERCIAL VALUE.",
