    "Description": "THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE ROOT COLLAPSE ASSOCIATED WITH HUANGLONGBING (HLB)-IMPACTED TREES AND WAYS TO MITIGATE IT BY PROMOTING ROOT HEALTH. OUR PREVIOUS WORK DEMONSTRATES THAT AS HLB SEVERITY INCREASES, THE ROOT MICROBIOME BECOMES ENRICHED IN SOIL-BORNE PATHOGENS. WE WILL CONDUCT EXPERIMENTS TO EMPIRICALLY DETERMINE IF THESE PATHOGENS EXACERBATE THE HLB-ASSOCIATED ROOT AND CANOPY DECLINE. WE WILL INTEGRATE FIELD STUDIES THAT TEST HLB RESISTANT/TOLERANT ROOTSTOCKS AND USE OF SOIL AMENDMENTS THAT PROMOTE ROOT HEALTH TO DETERMINE IF THEY SUPPRESS PATHOGENS IN THE ROOTS AND PROLONG TREE LONGEVITY/PRODUCTIVITY UNDER HLB PRESSURE. THESE FIELD STUDIES WILL INCLUDE NEWLY ESTABLISHED GROVES AND MATURE GROVES. TO SUPPORT OUR FIELD TRIALS AND DECIPHER THE GENES/GENE PATHWAYS THAT DICTATE HOW PLANTS RESPOND TO HLB, WE WILL DETERMINE HOW ROOTSTOCKS AND SCIONS RESPOND TOCANDIDATUSLIBERIBACTER ASIATICUS USING CITRUS VARIETIES THAT ARE EITHER HIGHLY HLB-SUSCEPTIBLE OR HLB-RESISTANT USING A COMBINATION OF DISEASE PHENOTYPING AND GENE EXPRESSION ANALYSES. WE WILL INTEGRATE THIS RESEARCH WITH A ROBUST EXTENSION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM IN COMBINATION WITH AN ECONOMIC COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS STRUCTURED AROUND ADOPTION OF TREATMENTS THAT ENHANCE ROOT HEALTH INTO COMMERCIAL CITRICULTURE.",
