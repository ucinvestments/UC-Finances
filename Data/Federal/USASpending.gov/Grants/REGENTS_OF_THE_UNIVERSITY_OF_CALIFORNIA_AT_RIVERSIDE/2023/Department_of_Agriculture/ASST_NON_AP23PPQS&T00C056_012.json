THE CCPP IS OPERATING ON SIX FUNCTIONAL PILLARS: 1. INTRODUCTION OF CITRUS VARIETIES UNDER QUARANTINE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 2. TESTING OF THE CITRUS VARIETIES’ PROPAGATIVE MATERIAL FOR GRAFT-TRANSMISSIBLE DISEASES/PATHOGENS 3. ELIMINATION OF GRAFT-TRANSMISSIBLE PATHOGENS FROM THE PROPAGATIVE MATERIAL 4. MAINTENANCE AND CONTINUOUS PATHOGEN RE-TESTING OF THE SOURCES OF THE CITRUS PROPAGATIVE MATERIAL 5. DISTRIBUTION OF PATHOGEN-TESTED AND TRUE-TO-TYPE PRIMARY CITRUS PROPAGATIVEMATERIAL 6. EXTENSION OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION FOR CITRUS DIAGNOSTICS, THERAPY, GERMPLASM, DISEASE MANAGEMENT, AND NOVEL CITRICULTURE TECHNOLOGIES. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE A SAFE MECHANISM FOR INTRODUCTION INTO CALIFORNIA AND NCPN-CITRUS OF CITRUS VARIETIES FROM ANY CITRUS-GROWING AREA OF THE WORLD FOR RESEARCH, VARIETY IMPROVEMENT, OR FOR USE BY THE COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY OR CITRUS ENTHUSIASTS, IN COMPLIANCE WITH STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND IT WILL PERFORM EXTENSION AND OUTREACH ON ALL TOPICS RELATED TO CITRUS CLEAN PLANT PROPAGATIVE MATERIALS.",
