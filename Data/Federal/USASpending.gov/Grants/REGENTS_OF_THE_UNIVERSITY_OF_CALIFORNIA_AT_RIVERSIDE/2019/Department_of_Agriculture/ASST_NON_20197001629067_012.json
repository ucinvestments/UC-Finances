    "Description": "THE CURRENT LACK OF METHODS TO EFFECTIVELY COMBAT HLB MAKES DISCOVERY OF INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES IMPERATIVE FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE CITRUS INDUSTRY. THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO PROVIDE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO CONTROL HLB BY DEVELOPING ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPIES TO SUPPRESS AND KILL CLAS IN HLB-POSITIVE TREES AND ANTIMICROBIAL PROTECTANTS TO VACCINATE HEALTHY YOUNG CITRUS TREES AGAINST INFECTION.THE PROJECT ADDRESSES THE FIRST CDS-CDRE PRIORITY AREA: 1. THERAPIES TO PREVENT OR SUPPRESS CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER ASIATICUS (CLAS) BACTERIA WITHIN TREES. OUR PROJECT IS BASED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE HLB RESISTANCE/TOLERANCE TRAITS OBSERVED IN CITRUS HYBRIDS AND CLOSE RELATIVES ARE DETERMINED BY A SET OF MASTER DEFENSE REGULATORS. BY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS BETWEEN HLB-SENSITIVE CULTIVARS AND HLB-RESISTANT/TOLERANT CITRUS HYBRIDS AND RELATIVES, SUCH AS EREMOCITRUS GLAUCA, MICROCITRUS AUSTRALIASICA, AND PONCIRUS TRIFOLIATA, WE IDENTIFIED AND CLONED A NOVEL CLASS OF ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES(APS) THAT CAN EFFECTIVELY INHIBIT/KILL THREE DIFFERENT LIBERIBACTER SPECIES, 1) CLAS THAT INFECTS CITRUS, 2) CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER SOLANACEARUM THAT INFECTS ALL SOLANACEOUS PLANTS AND 3) LIBERIBACTER CRESCENS, A CULTURABLE BACTERIUM THAT INFECTS PAPAYA, WHICH WE ARE USING AS A SURROGATE FOR THE UNCULTURABLE CLAS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE APS HAVE UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE DISTINCT FROM OTHER ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES AND MAKE THEM THE IDEAL SOLUTIONS FOR CONTROLLING HLB. FIRST, THE APS CAN STIMULATE IMMUNE RESPONSES IN CITRUS PLANTS, WHICH MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP PROTECTANTS USING APS TO VACCINATE HEALTHY SEEDLINGS. SECOND, THE APS ARE SAFE FOR HUMANS AND ANIMALS BECAUSE THEY ARE DERIVED FROM CITRUS AND CITRUS RELATIVES AND ARE PRESENT IN FRUIT OF AUSTRALIAN FINGER LIME AND LEMON, WHICH PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CONSUMING FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS. THIRD, THE APS ARE STABLE AND CAN WITHSTAND HIGH TEMPERATURES AND PROTEOLYSIS IN PLANTS. FOURTH, THE APS HAVE NO OBVIOUS PHYTOTOXICITY IN CITRUS. AND FIFTH, SYNTHESIS OF THE APS IS COST-EFFECTIVE. UNLIKE MOST OTHER ANTIMICROBIAL PEPTIDES THAT ARE CYSTINE-RICH AND REQUIRE DISULFIDE BOND FORMATION TO BE ACTIVE, OUR APS DO NOT CONTAIN MANY CYSTINE RESIDUES, WHICH ALLOWS IN VITRO SYNTHESIS OF ACTIVE MOLECULES EASILY AND AT LOW COST.WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THERAPIES AND PROTECTANTS USING AP SOLUTIONS AND PERFORM AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE COST EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT APPLICATION METHODS FOR TREATING HLB-POSITIVE TREES AND PROPHYLACTICALLY PROTECTING HEALTHY YOUNG TREES AGAINST CLAS INFECTION. VARIOUS COCKTAILS OF APS WILL BE FORMULATED, AND DIFFERENT DELIVERY METHODS WILL BE TESTED IN THE GREENHOUSE (DRS. JIN AND GODFREY IN CA, DRS. MCCOLLUM AND FOLIMONOVA IN FL) AND FIELD (DRS. MCCOLLUM AND DEWDNEY IN FL). THE AP SOLUTIONS AND DELIVERY METHODS PROVEN MOST EFFECTIVE WILL BE INTRODUCED TO GROWERS FOR FIELD EVALUATION. WE WILL ALSO TEST THE DELIVERY OF APS VIA EXPRESSION FROM A MODIFIED CITRUS TRISTEZA VIRUS VECTOR, WHICH HAS ALREADYBEEN DEVELOPED (DR. FOLIMONOVA AND SOUTHERN GARDENS. INC). THE AGRICULTURAL ECONOMIST DR. BABCOCK FROM UCR WILL PERFORM ECONOMIC ANALYSIS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF USING THE ANTI-MICROBIAL COCKTAILS.WE PROPOSE TO DEVELOP THERAPIES AND PROTECTANTS USING AP SOLUTIONS AND PERFORM AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE COST EFFICIENCY OF DIFFERENT APPLICATION METHODS FOR TREATING HLB-POSITIVE TREES AND PROPHYLACTICALLY PROTECTING HEALTHY YOUNG TREES AGAINST CLAS INFECTION.

WE WILL PREPARE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS THAT WILL BE DELIVERED TO STAKEHOLDERS VIA CITRUS INDUSTRY MEETINGS NATIONWIDE IN CA, TX AND FL (FL: CITRUS EXPO AND CITRUS SHOW; CA: CITRUS RESEARCH BOARD\u0026#39;S MEETINGS, CA CITRUS MUTUAL; CITRUS CLONAL PROTECTION PROGRAM ANNUAL WALK THROUGH; FIELD DAYS AT UCR; AND TX: TEXAS CITRUS SHOWCASE). THESE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WILL INCLUDE 1) POWERPOINT PRESENTATIONS; AND 2) HARD COPY PAMPHLETS DESCRIBING THE PROJECT, 3) A PROJECT WEBSITE, AND 4) A FRUITMENTORTM YOUTUBE VIDEO. HOMEOWNERS AND CITRUS HOBBYISTS (GENERAL PUBLIC) WILL ALSO BE TARGETED BY DISTRIBUTING INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HLB AND ACP AND HOW THEY CAN BECOME PART OF THE HLB SOLUTION. ALL EXTENSION AND OUTREACH MATERIALS WILL ALSO BE PART OF THE PROJECT WEBSITE. EDUCATIONAL OUTREACH WILL ALSO BE PART OF THIS PROJECT THROUGH THE LOUIS STOKES ALLIANCE FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION, CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR MINORITY PARTICIPATION (CAMP). GROWER STAKEHOLDERS AND INDUSTRY REPRESENTATIVES FROM CA, FL AND TX WILL ALSO BE INCLUDED ON OUR ADVISORY PANEL. THE PD, DR. JIN, HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN PUBLIC EDUCATION ON CITRUS HLB DISEASES AND TO WORK WITH CALIFORNIA CITRUS PEST \u0026AMP; DISEASE PREVENTION PROGRAM THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH TV REPORTERS AND NEWSPAPER JOURNALISTS AT MEDIA CONFERENCES AND ENGAGEMENT WITH LOCAL COMMUNITIES.",
