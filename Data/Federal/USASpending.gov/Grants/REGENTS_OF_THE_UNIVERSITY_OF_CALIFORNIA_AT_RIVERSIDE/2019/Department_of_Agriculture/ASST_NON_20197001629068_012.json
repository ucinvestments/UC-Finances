    "Description": "NEW CULTIVARS OF CROP PLANTS ARE OFTEN NEEDED TO ADDRESS EMERGING CHALLENGES, TO MEET THE NEEDS OF FARMERS, TO DEVELOP SUSTAINABLE CROP CULTIVATION METHODS, AND TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. THE CITRUS INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS FACED WITH A DEADLY DISEASE, HUANGLONGBING (HLB) OR CITRUS GREENING THAT HAS RAVAGED MANY CITRUS GROWING REGIONS IN THE COUNTRY AND HAS CAUSED SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN OTHER AREAS WHERE THE DISEASE IS NOW SPREADING. THE SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF THE DISEASE, THE UN-CULTURABLE NATURE OF THE ASSOCIATED CAUSAL ORGANISM, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE PATHOSYSTEM MAKE CONTROLLING THIS DISEASE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT. A REVIEW PUBLISHED BY THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE IN 2018 SUMMARIZED THE RESULTS OF ABOUT 12 YEARS OF RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON FINDING SOLUTIONS TO THE CITRUS HLB PROBLEM AND DECLARED THAT HLB MAY BE THE GREATEST CHALLENGE FACED BY THE CITRUS INDUSTRIES IN THE WESTERN WORLD. SINCE CITRUS IS ECONOMICALLY AND CULTURALLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR BOTH FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA, WE NEED TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS FOR LONG TERM CULTIVATION OF THIS IMPORTANT FRUIT CROP. THE DISEASE IS ASSOCIATED WITH CANDIDATUS LIBERIBACTER ASIATICUS, AN UNCULTURABLE ALPHA-PROTEOBACTERIUM AND IS SPREAD BY THE ASIAN CITRUS PSYLLID. EFFICIENT DISEASE MITIGATION WILL BE FEASIBLE WITH ADEQUATE VECTOR CONTROL. IMPLEMENTING MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES FOR DISEASE MITIGATION WILL ALSO RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR CULTIVATING CITRUS AND SOME OF THE APPROACHES PRACTICED NOW MAY RESULT IN DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES, IN FLORIDA WHERE THE DISEASE HAS ESTABLISHED FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS, THE COST FOR CARING OF AN ACRE OF CITRUS HAS INCREASED FROM AN AVERAGE OF $769 IN THE YEAR 2000 TO ABOUT $2376 IN 2017. ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ECONOMICALLY SUSTAINABLE SOLUTIONS FOR CITRUS CULTIVATION IN PRESENCE OF HLB WILL REQUIRE DEVELOPMENT OF DISEASE RESISTANCE. AVAILABILITY OF COMMERCIAL VARIETIES THAT ARE RESISTANT WILL PROVIDE LONG-TERM, ECO-FRIENDLY, AND COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THIS DEVASTATING DISEASE. THERE IS NO REPORT OF RESISTANCE TO HLB IN CITRUS. BECAUSE OF LONG CULTIVATION AND VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION METHODS USED ROUTINELY, NEW GENETIC MATERIAL IS OFTEN NOT INTRODUCED INTO CULTIVATED CITRUS AND THE CURRENTLY GROWN VARIETIES HAVE A NARROW GENETIC BASE. HOWEVER, CERTAIN RELATED GENERA IN THE CITRUS FAMILY ARE HLB RESISTANT OR HIGHLY TOLERANT. WE HAVE EXPLORED THE GENETIC DIVERSITY IN CLOSE RELATIVES OF CITRUS AND IDENTIFIED SOURCES OF HLB RESISTANCE IN AUSTRALIAN LIMES. USING THESE SEXUALLY COMPATIBLE DISEASE RESISTANT TAXA, WE HAVE GENERATED HYBRIDS OF CITRUS BY BREEDING WITH HLB RESISTANT CITRUS RELATIVES. MANY OF THE HYBRID PLANTS THAT WE HAVE DEVELOPED ARE VERY PROMISING SINCE THEY DO NOT HARBOR THE HLB PATHOGEN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS (MORE THAN TWO YEARS). OUR HYBRIDS ARE NOW UNDERGOING FIELD EVALUATIONS. ONE CAVEAT IS THAT THE HYBRID PLANTS INHERIT UNDESIRABLE FRUIT CHARACTERS ALONG WITH RESISTANCE TRAITS FROM THE CITRUS RELATIVE PARENT.TRADITIONAL BREEDING TO ELIMINATE UNWANTED FRUIT CHARACTERS WHILE MAINTAINING RESISTANCE WILL BE FEASIBLE BUT TIME CONSUMING. CITRUS HAS A GENERATION TIME OF 4-7 YEARS (DEPENDING ON CULTIVARS). USING A BREEDING POPULATION OF HYBRID PLANTS THAT ARE EITHER RESISTANT OR SUSCEPTIBLE, WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE MODERN GENETICS METHODS TO GENERATE MOLECULAR TOOLS THAT WILL BE USEFUL IN DEVELOPING COMMERCIAL CITRUS CULTIVARS RESISTANT TO HLB. NOVEL INNOVATIVE METHODS OF CROP IMPROVEMENT ARE NOW POSSIBLE WITH ADVANCED AND AFFORDABLE SEQUENCING TECHNOLOGIES, GENE EDITING PROCEDURES AND ABILITY TO PYRAMID USEFUL GENES IN TRANSFORMED PLANTS. IDENTIFICATION OF TARGET GENES AND AVAILABILITY OF RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED GENES WILL BE NECESSARY TO UTILIZE THESE TECHNOLOGIES TO OUR ADVANTAGE. ADVANCES IN GENETICS AND GENOMICS MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE BASIS OF RESISTANCE AND IDENTIFY GENES THAT CAN THEN BE INTRODUCED INTO SPECIFIC CULTIVARS SO THAT HLB RESISTANCE CAN BE DEVELOPED IN COMMERCIAL CULTIVARS WITHOUT ALTERING THE DESIRABLE HORTICULTURAL TRAITS. IN THIS PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO UTILIZE HYBRID POPULATIONS OF CITRUS (DERIVED FROM CROSSING CITRUS WITH DISEASE RESISTANT RELATIVE GENERA) TO GENERATE SEQUENCE INFORMATION THAT WILL LEAD TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF GENOMIC REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH HLB RESISTANCE. USING A COMBINATION OF SEVERAL GENOMIC APPROACHES (WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING, LOW DEPTH SKIM SEQUENCING OF HLB RESISTANT AND SUSCEPTIBLE F1 POPULATIONS, POOLED GENOME APPROACH, TRANSCRIPTOME PROFILING, QPCR ANALYSIS FOR DETERMINING GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES, AND BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSIS), WE PROPOSE TO IDENTIFY GENES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HLB RESISTANCE. FOR PROOF OF CONCEPT, WE WILL CLONE THE PUTATIVE RESISTANCE ASSOCIATED GENES INTO SUITABLE PLANT TRANSFORMATION VECTORS AND TRANSFORM A MODEL CITRUS PLANT, DUNCAN GRAPEFRUIT. THE TRANSFORMED PLANT WILL BE TESTED FOR PRESENCE OF TRANSGENE, EXPRESSION LEVELS, STABILITY, AND EVALUATED FOR HLB RESISTANCE. USEFUL CONSTRUCTS/GENES/INFORMATION ABOUT RESISTANT GENES WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR GENERATING DISEASE RESISTANT CITRUS CULTIVARS USING MANY NOVEL TECHNOLOGIES. DEVELOPMENT OF GENOMICS-BASED TOOLS THAT CAN BE USED TO SELECT POTENTIALLY RESISTANT PROGENY WILL ALSO ACCELERATE TRADITIONAL BREEDING APPROACHES. GENES FOR HLB RESISTANCE, ONCE IDENTIFIED AND VALIDATED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, RIVERSIDE, WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE APPROPRIATE UNIVERSITY TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER MECHANISMS, INCLUDING PATENTING AND LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP), INTER-INSTITUTIONAL, MATERIAL TRANSFER, AND CONFIDENTIAL DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTS, SO THAT OTHERS CAN INCORPORATE THE HLB RESISTANT GENES INTO VARIOUS CITRUS CULTIVARS TO EXPEDITIOUSLY TRANSLATE THE RESEARCH RESULTS FOR COMMERCIAL APPLICATION TO SUPPORT THE CITRUS INDUSTRY. THE PROJECT HAS A MULTI-STATE ADVISORY PANEL CONSISTING OF A CITRUS SCIENTIST, A CITRUS NURSERYMAN, AN APPLE BREEDER AND A CITRUS PATHOLOGIST. THE ADVISORY BOARD WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON GOALS, APPROACHES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS.",
