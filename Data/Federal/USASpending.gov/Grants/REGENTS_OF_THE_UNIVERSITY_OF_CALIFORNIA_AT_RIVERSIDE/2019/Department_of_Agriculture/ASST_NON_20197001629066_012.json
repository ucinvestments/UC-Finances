    "Description": "HUANGLONGBING (HLB) IS A CITRUS DISEASE THAT IS CURRENTLY CAUSING ANNUAL LOSSES OF OVER 1 BILLION DOLLARS AND 7,900 JOBS IN FLORIDA. AS HLB SPREADS ACROSS THE US, HUGE LOSSES ARE ALSO EXPECTED IN ALL OF THE OTHER CITRUS PRODUCING REGIONS. CURRENT HLB MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE NOT EFFECTIVE, AND THEY OFTEN INVOLVE REGULAR APPLICATIONS OF INSECTICIDES, WHICH CAN HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN HEALTH. IT IS THEREFORE IMPERATIVE THAT EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE HLB MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE DEVELOPED.THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE HLB TREATMENTS THAT CAN BOTH PREVENT AND CURE THIS DISEASE. OUR APPROACH WILL USE A VIRUS (CTV) TO DELIVER ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS TO THE HABITAT (PHLOEM) OF THE HLB-ASSOCIATED PATHOGEN (CLAS). TO SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF THIS APPROACH, WE ARE BORROWING A METHOD THAT IS USED IN HUMAN INFECTIOUS DISEASE, WHICH ENGINEERS PEPTIDES TO SPECIFICALLY TARGET THE PATHOGEN. THIS APPROACH SHOULD INCREASE THE EFFICACIES OF OUR ANTI-CLAS AGENTS BY SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL TRANSFORM AN HLB TREATMENT THAT IS MINIMALLY TO MODERATELY EFFECTIVE INTO ONE THAT IS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE. THIS PROJECT WILL ALSO CREATE A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL OF HLB, WHICH WILL ENABLE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF CLAS, CITRUS AND THE INSECT THAT TRANSMITS CLAS (ACP), ALONG WITH ALL OF THEIR INTERACTIONS. THIS MODEL WILL THEREFORE PROVIDE RESEARCHERS, ENGINEERS AND AGRIBUSINESSES WITH A POWERFUL SUITE OF TOOLS AND AN UNPRECEDENTED KNOWLEDGE BASE - WHICH WE EXPECT WILL ENABLE THEM TO CREATE (I) ANTI-CLAS MOLECULES, (II) HLB-TOLERANT/RESISTANT CITRUS (III) EARLY DETECTION METHODS AS WELL AS (IV) MEDIA TO CULTIVATE CLAS UNDER LABORATORY CONDITIONS. THIS PROJECT ADDRESSES 5 OF THE 7 PRIORITIES OF THE CITRUS DISEASE SUBCOMMITTEE, DESCRIBED IN THE REQUEST FOR APPLICATIONS FROM THE CITRUS DISEASE RESEARCH AND EXTENSION PROGRAM. OUR PROJECT WILL ALSO PERFORM ANALYSES TO DETERMINE IF OUR HLB MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS WILL BE ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE. IN ADDITION, WE WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT AN EXTENSION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM FOR THE CITRUS STAKEHOLDER COMMUNITY, THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY. WE WILL DISSEMINATE INFORMATION IN THREE GENERAL CATEGORIES. THE FIRST CATEGORY WILL BE THE HLB MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS GENERATED BY THIS PROJECT. THE SECOND CATEGORY WILL BE OUR RESEARCH FINDINGS. THE THIRD CATEGORY WILL BE GENERAL HLB INFORMATION. THE INFORMATION WILL BE DISSEMINATED BY SEVERAL MECHANISMS INCLUDING PRESENTATIONS, PUBLICATIONS, A WEBSITE AND VIDEOS.IN SUM, THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO CREATE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE STRATEGIES TO MANAGE HLB. WE EXPECT THAT SUCCESS IN THESE EFFORTS WILL (I) PREVENT ENORMOUS ECONOMIC AND JOB LOSSES AS WELL AS (II) PREVENT SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HUMAN HEALTH.",
