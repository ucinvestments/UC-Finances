Key Notes:

    Blue & Gold Endowment holdings are NOT disclosed despite policy requiring it
    Private equity/credit holdings are largely exempt from disclosure
    UC removed their sponsored projects dashboard in late 2024, eliminating historical contract data
    Form 13F filings show UC reclassified many holdings in Q2 2024, claiming lack of discretionary authority

Recommended Starting Points:

    Start with the UC Investments holdings disclosure page for GEP and UCRP
    Check quarterly 13F filings on SEC EDGAR
    Use proxy voting records to identify indirect holdings
    Submit public records requests to individual campus foundations for their holdings
